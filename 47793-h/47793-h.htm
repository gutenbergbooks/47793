</div>
  <h2 id='chap01' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER I</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>THE FLIGHT OF THE LONE STAR</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>The air above the Brazilian jungles along the
dark waters of the Rio Branco in northern Brazil
was full of sound. The roar and thunder of many
motors beat down upon the sea of waving treetops
until it seemed to stir them into animated life. A
formation of great, four-motored planes was passing
over.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two natives in a small dugout on the river
dropped their paddles into their wooden canoe, then
sat staring upward. The river’s current swept them
beneath the branches of a dead mango tree. One of
them reached up to snap off a brittle branch.</p>

<p class='c012'>Breaking pieces from this branch he placed them,
one by one, in the bottom of the canoe. When
there were thirty-eight pieces, he stopped to sit as
if in a trance watching those great, man-made birds
go sweeping on.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>Presently his companion grunted, then pointed
at the sky upstream. The first native again looked
skyward, then placed two more sticks with the
others, making forty in all. Then he drawled a few
native words that in our language mean:</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of these big birds is very sick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This native was old. He had lived long beneath
the overhanging treetops. He knew the ways of
birds and men, but not of airplanes. For all that, he
was right. One of these flying things of metal was
sick, very sick.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as he said the words, there came a sudden
burst of thunder, and the larger of the two planes,
the one that was not “sick,” a ship so well formed—sleek
and beautiful—that a native’s eyes shone at
sight of it, pulled away from its slow, sick companion
and went speeding along over the forest that
lined the downsweep of the river.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gone,” said the native. “Now this one will die.”
His eyes shone with a new light. Once on the Rio
Negro, he had seen one of these man-made birds.
There had been much on that plane that he had
coveted. And now—</p>

<p class='c012'>These last two planes were not bombers, but
transport planes. It was quite evident that the
speeding plane had not deserted its companion, for,
in a short time, it came roaring back and a girl’s
voice speaking into a radio said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a rather large clearing about fifty miles
down. Think you can make it?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>“We’ll have to try,” came in a man’s strong, even
tone. “We’re on one motor now. The other is cutting
out on me. Can’t tell how soon it will quit
dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll tag along,” came in the girl’s voice. “If
you make it—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we get that far, we’ll try a landing,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if anything goes wrong—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll fly right on.” The man’s voice was harsh,
insistent. “Remember! Secret—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t say it, Sparky!” The girl’s voice rose sharp
as an alarmed bird’s. “Don’t say it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right! All right!” the man’s voice grumbled
into the tropical air. “Then I won’t say it. All the
same—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same, if you go down there we’re coming
right down after you,” the girl insisted. “You know
what our orders were, to fly in pairs. If one plane is
disabled, its mate must go to the rescue. All other
planes must go straight on. We’re on a mission of
destruction. That’s all we know. It’s urgent. We
must go through!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay, sister, that’s why you should fly right on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we won’t.” The girl spoke quietly. “If you
crack up, we’ll be right down. This ship has control.
I can land her on a dime.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>“But don’t forget—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never forget,” the girl snapped. “Now go on
down there and try your luck. It’s all that’s left to
do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’d he mean—secret?” The blonde-haired
girl who sat in the co-pilot seat beside the girl who
had carried on that spirited conversation, drawled,
“What secret?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sorry, Janet,” was the slow reply. “You’ve heard
of military secrets, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For Pete’s sake, Mary Mason! Yes! Of course, I
have, but I don’t see—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is one of them.” Mary Mason, the little girl
who piloted a big plane, favored her with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, save for the slow drone of motors,
there was quiet in the cabin, a tense sort of calm,
such as comes before a storm. After a time the
blonde-haired Janet said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky’s motors didn’t stop all by themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course they didn’t. Sparky’s too good a pilot
for that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He sure is. It’s the work of the enemy. That’s
what it is. He knows. He’s after us, after you and
Sparky, Don and me. He’s got us coming down in a
jungle and we’re only just out of good, old U.S.A.
And think of the dizzy miles still ahead of us! And
the enemy dogging our luck all the way!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought of him before I started,” Mary replied
quietly. “Let him do his worst. We’ll win, you’ll
see!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>For the swift, powerful twin-motored transport
plane flown by Mary Mason, the distance to that
native clearing on the Rio Branco was just a jump,
but she did not jump. Instead she followed doggedly
on behind her limping companion. And as she
followed, she found time to think. Those were long,
long thoughts.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was a member of the WAFS, Women’s Auxiliary
Ferrying Squadron, this slender girl with the
flashing black eyes and trigger-quick fingers. For six
wintry months she had flown planes from east to
west, from north to south, and all the way back
again. Sometimes these planes were transport planes
or bombers with comfortable, heated cabins. More
often they were open-seated trainers or fighters. She
flew them in wind, rain, and snow. Mile after weary
mile in lonely solitude she had gone roaring through
the night sky to arrive at last at her destination only
to be ushered aboard an airways plane and hurried
back again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was hard,” she said to Janet Janes, her companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure it was,” the other girl agreed. “Looks as if
this would be harder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps,” Mary answered. “But just think!
In the past two days it’s been San Francisco to Denver,
to Chicago, to Miami!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>“To Caracas, and then to the heart of a jungle
where headhunters beat on hollow logs inviting
their friends to a feast.” Janet laughed in spite of
herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This will be just a pause,” Mary insisted stoutly.
“After that it will be Para, to Dakar in Africa, Dakar
to Egypt and the pyramids, Egypt to Persia—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Under the Persian moon,” Janet sang softly.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Watch!” Mary exclaimed. “There’s the clearing.
Sparky has spotted it. He’s preparing to circle.
He’s going down!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Mary set her motors thundering. After
climbing steeply she leveled off to stare down at the
clearing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He didn’t go down, not yet,” Janet informed her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. There are people running from that row
of native huts. He’d hit them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’re like ants coming from an ant hill. They
don’t seem important.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! But they are!” Mary exclaimed. “Every
human life is important. Besides, if Sparky killed
just one of them, our lives wouldn’t be worth a
penny. We’re in the wilds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Probably not a white man within a hundred
miles.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Or perhaps a thousand.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>“I wish we might go on.” A suggestion of strain
crept into Janet’s voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! But we can’t.” Mary’s plane was circling
slowly now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course we couldn’t go on,” she told herself.
“Not even if Sparky insisted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Through her racing mind whirled memories of
other days, those bad days of winter convoy in
America. There had been only twenty-five of them,
twenty-five WAFS, and so much work to do. Always,
on her return from a long, hard trip, muddy, chilled
through and half-starved, if he chanced to be in, she
had found Sparky waiting in his car to whisk her
away to her barracks and after that to a glorious hot
meal. “Thick, juicy steaks, French fries, lemon pie,
and barrels of hot coffee,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now Sparky was down there below her in his
disabled plane waiting, waiting for the last darting
spot to glide from those huts into the bush that lay
beyond. No, they could not go on. “Not even for
the secret—” she spoke aloud, then checked herself
just in time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He can’t climb,” she said to Janet. “He can only
circle. And if his other motor quits he may go crashing
straight down!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There!” Janet breathed. “Now there’s no one!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, just one more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A very small black spot, moving, oh, so slowly,
went weaving this way, then that, toward the forest.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>“A child!” Mary exclaimed. “How Sparky would
hate hitting a child!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now!” Janet breathed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” Mary groaned. “One more, a smaller one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed an eternity before this last child had
reached safety.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of a sudden the plane beneath them lunged downward.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There they go!” Janet gasped while Mary’s
clutching fingers fairly bit into the stick.</p>

<p class='c012'>But no, Sparky’s plane seemed to shudder. No
doubt his motor had quit, then gone on again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why doesn’t he go down?” Mary groaned.
“Here, take the plane!” She gave Janet her place.
“Just circle slowly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With long, swift strides she reached the plane’s
door. There she braced herself, then stood watching
the plane below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s going down,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was true. Circling slowly, cautiously, Sparky
nursed his disabled plane at last into a smooth glide
that brought him swiftly down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s out too far,” she groaned. “He’s afraid
there’s just one more native child.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There!” she exclaimed. “He’s down!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She saw the big plane bump hard, then bump—bump
again. It did not heel over, but went gliding
straight on.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>“He made it!” she screamed aloud. “Oh! Glory!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Bright hopes sped through her mind. The defective
motors would soon be repaired. Before the
natives returned they would once again rise high
above the jungle and speed away to rejoin their
convoy. She had begun to feel dreadfully lonesome
away from all that thundering flight. At Para, they
would be united and then—</p>

<p class='c012'>Her thoughts broke off. Her lips parted in a
scream that did not come. Of a sudden the ship
down there on the ground, gliding forward, had
whirled half about. Its right wing crumpled; it
turned toward the black waters of the river. After
gliding forward half the distance to those threatening
waters, it came to a sudden halt, then crumpled
into a heap.</p>

<p class='c012'>With lips parted she kept her eyes glued upon
the plane. Would it be set on fire? A slow smoke
rose, but no flames.</p>

<p class='c012'>A figure came tumbling from the plane. “One
more!” she whispered. “Just one more!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The figure that had appeared remained motionless
for a space of seconds. Then he leaped forward
to re-enter the wreck.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of them is hurt,” she called to Janet. “Keep
circling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was true, for soon the single figure appeared
once more, this time bearing a limp burden.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>“Janet,” Mary exclaimed as she resumed control
of the plane, “we’re going down!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” said Janet, “is a large plane. Larger than
Sparky’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And easier to control. This,” said Mary proudly,
“is the Lone Star, the only plane of its kind in the
world!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s almost priceless,” Janet agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and its cargo is really priceless,” Mary might
have added, but did not for that was her military
secret, hers and Sparky’s. The C.O. had told just
that to her before they took off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am putting it on your plane,” the C.O. had
said, “because your Lone Star is the fastest, strongest,
most dependable transport plane we have in our outfit.
And I have given the plane to you because other
than two pilots that cannot be spared, you are the
only one who knows her and can take her safely
through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This, she realized, had been high praise. Hers was
a grave responsibility, but Sparky, her good pal, was
down there. Was he the one who had been injured?
She had no way of knowing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going down,” she repeated softly.</p>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER II</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>SAVAGES AND THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>As the big plane circled, drifting slowly down,
Mary leaned over to say in a deep, impressive voice:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Janet, if we crash, and there’s a spark of life in
you, get out quick and run, crawl, anything. Get
away fast.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who wouldn’t?” Janet stared. “If the ship gets
on fire the gas tanks will explode and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s worse than that,” Mary confided. “This ship
is mined.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mined!” Janet stared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It certainly is! And by our own people. This is
one ship our enemies will never take apart piece by
piece, nor its cargo either. In case of a crash, it will
be torn to ribbons.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That—why, that’s terrible,” Janet’s voice was
husky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not as bad as it seems,” was the slow reply.
“Only fire will set off the explosives. Bumping won’t
do it. There’s a fuse, too. I know right where it is.
No, they’ll never get the Lone Star or her cargo.
And there’s nothing they’d like half as much to do.
But they won’t get her. Never! Never.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>“And now,” she breathed. “Here we go!”</p>

<p class='c012'>As her ship glided down, even in this moment
when her own fate seemed to hang in the balance,
on the walls of Mary’s mind was painted a picture
that would not soon be erased. It was as if her first
glimpse of a tropical jungle, the waving palms, the
slow, rolling black river, the native huts, the sloping
hillside all bathed in a beautiful sunset, had been
painted there by some great artist.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then her ship’s landing wheels touched the
broad, hard-trodden path of the natives. Coming in
closer to the natives’ shacks she had avoided the
treacherous hillside and suddenly, there she was.
Graceful as a plover with wings outspread the Lone
Star came to rest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We made it!” Mary gave vent to a heavy sigh of
relief. “But now!” She was up and away in the
same breath, for the solving of one difficult problem
had only served to bring her closer to another.
There had been two men in the bomber when it
crashed, Sparky Ames and Don Nelson. One had
been injured. Which one? And how badly? She
had to know.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going over there!” she exclaimed as she
leaped from the plane, at the same time pointing up
the hill.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay. I’ll watch this plane,” Janet said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I think that’s wise. You never can tell.”</p>

<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Mary cast an apprehensive glance at the long row
of native houses. “Homes of a hundred people,” she
thought. “Perfectly wild natives.” But now nothing
stirred there.</p>

<p class='c012'>With long, quick strides she made her way where
one man bent over the prostrate form of another.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she was half way there she saw the kneeling
man turn his head. Then she knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sparky!” she exclaimed. “You’re safe!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! What’d you think?” The tall, strongly
built young man with black, kinky hair grinned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I didn’t know.” She was closer now. “It
would have been terrible if you had been seriously
injured, you know.” Her voice dropped. “Secret
cargo!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But Don!” she exclaimed. “Is he badly injured?”
She was standing beside Sparky now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t tell yet,” was the slow answer. “I have
the courage to hope not. He got a bang on the head.
That knocked him out. I’ve felt him over pretty
carefully. No bones broken is my guess. But he
keeps groaning. His hand comes up to his chest.
Got a cracked rib or two I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s bad, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bad enough, but it might be worse. Anyway,
our plane can never be repaired. Not here it can’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And how will you ever get it out?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>“That’s it,” he agreed. “Looks as if we’re stuck—at
least, our plane is. Guess we’ll have to go it alone,
Mary, just you and I. It’s the way the Chief would
want it.” His voice went husky. “That secret cargo
must go through at all cost. Those were the orders.
How do you feel about that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How would you feel about going over the top
somewhere in Africa?” she challenged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wouldn’t think. I’d just go, same as any other
soldier does.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the same with me now,” she replied soberly.
“I—am a soldier, too. Well, perhaps not quite, but
I’m serving in a soldier’s plane, a mighty good one,
too. Any man in my shoes would have to have had
five hundred hours in the air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so where duty calls or danger—” he quoted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall always hope to be there,” she saluted.
“But look!” she exclaimed. “Don is trying to sit up.
He must not do that!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! No! Old man! Not yet!” Once again
Sparky was at his comrade’s side gently pushing him
down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wh—where am I? Who—what happened?” came
in thick tones.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re here and we’re here. Sparky and Mary,”
said Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Then it—it’s all right.” The injured man
settled back.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>“I’ll go get some pneumatic pillows,” Mary
volunteered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and something hot to drink,” Sparky suggested.
“That will help a lot.” Mary was away.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Don had fully recovered consciousness and
had been made as comfortable as possible, they
gathered around him for a council of war.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s getting dark,” said Sparky. “In another quarter
of an hour it will be darker than a stack of black
cats. In this land the dawn comes up like thunder,
and the sun blinks out in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And there’s no moon,” said Janet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All of which means we’re here for the night,”
said Mary. “Sparky,” her voice seemed a little
strained. “What kind of a country is this?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good head-hunting country,” Sparky laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, but really, we’ve got to face facts,” Mary insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Truth is,” said Sparky, “I don’t know about the
upper waters of the Amazon, or the people who live
here. Do the rest of you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There came a chorus of “no”s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, then we’ll be prepared for the worst
and hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They scattered fast enough when they saw us
coming down,” Don volunteered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was natural,” said Sparky. “It is also
natural to suppose that, in the end, they’ll defend
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>their homes. They may come back in the night.
There are two loose machine guns in each plane.
The Major had them put there for just such a time
as this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And for the time when we’ll be over battle
zones,” Mary added. “We may be attacked—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just now we’re in a jungle, so we’ll limber up
the guns,” said Sparky. “How about you ladies fixing
up a little chow?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure, oh, sure! We’ll do that!” was the quick
response.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the time Sparky had two guns set up in the
Lone Star, which he figured might, in the event of
an attack in force, be used as a fort, and had dragged
the other guns to the spot, a short distance away,
which they had chosen as a camp site, darkness had
fallen and the girls had coffee brewing over a cheerful
fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say! This is great!” Sparky exclaimed. “I’ve always
wanted to go camping but never had time!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” Don drawled, “You’ve got about ten
hours now with nothing else to do but camp.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Unless we’re attacked,” Janet supplemented
with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why bring that up?” Mary laughed. “Dinner is
about ready to serve. Let’s make it a date.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A date it is,” Sparky agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>Their grub box contained a little more than iron
rations. Sweet potatoes and sausages each served
from a can, big, round white crackers, a square of
butter and, aromatic coffee with real sugar and
canned cream, made up the bulk of their satisfying
meal. Dessert was little wild bananas, and huge,
over-ripe grapefruit that were sweet as oranges.
These came from the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Um,” Janet breathed. “That was really a feast.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and listen!” Mary exclaimed low, “What
was that? Really something different!”</p>

<p class='c012'>A low rolling sound had come drifting in out of
the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A native drum!” was Sparky’s instant answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they listened from farther away came the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Talking drums,” Mary whispered. “I never expected
to hear them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was hearing them all the same and, coming as
they did out of the night with the low murmur of
the dark, rushing river as their accompaniment,
they sounded weird indeed. Now came a roar close
at hand, <i>tom-tom-tom</i> sharp and clear, and now from
far away with the booms blended into one long roar.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Night in the jungle,” Mary whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Crawl into your ship and forget it,” Sparky suggested.
“We’ll be here in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I never could do that,” Janet exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>“All right,” said Sparky. “Then you girls keep the
first watch and I’ll sleep. But first we’ll fix Don
up as comfortable as we can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Don whose eyes first closed in slumber.
With soft pneumatic cushions under him and a mosquito
canopy to protect him and a soothing capsule
to allay his pain, he was asleep before the others
could arrange for the watches of the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just as Sparky crept away to the Lone Star for
three winks a bright golden moon came rolling
along the fringe of the forest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! That’s better!” Janet exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Was it? It was not long before every shadow cast
by the moon appeared to move and the darkened
grass houses seemed alive with people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ghosts,” Mary whispered. “Ghosts of native men
and women who lived here long before we were
born.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be still!” Janet whispered. “I heard a voice. It
was somewhere down the river. Listen!”</p>

<p class='c012'>As they listened a voice seemed to ask: “Why?
why? why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” Mary laughed low. “That’s a big, old
tree frog. He lives in a pool of green water in a hollow
tree, way up high. I read about it once. If you
drink the water he lives in you’ll go crazy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you might,” Janet whispered. “What do
you suppose he wants to know with his eternal
‘why’?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>“Perhaps he wants to know why we are here, why
my father is out somewhere in Africa.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And why my two brothers are in Australia,” said
Janet. “Do you know the answer?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Mary. “At least not all the answer. I
only know that we must keep on being here, and in
Africa, Egypt, Syria, India, China, wherever we’re
sent until this terrible war is over and all our loved
ones can come home again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s right. But, Mary, you know we were
volunteers. We didn’t have to join up. And above
all, we didn’t have to go on this long, long trip so
far from home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This Mary knew was true. They had, in truth,
volunteered twice. Joining the WAFS was purely
on a voluntary basis. Once they were in they were
expected to ferry planes from place to place in their
own country. But a sudden, urgent call had come
from China for forty planes, all but two of them
bombers. There were not enough men available so
volunteers were called from among the women.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All of us volunteered, except those who had children,”
Janet said, thinking aloud.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who wouldn’t? It’s what I’ve always wanted
most.” Mary’s voice rose a little. “When Sparky
used to come in after a week’s absence and say,
‘Hello, sister, I’m just back from Russia,’ I was
burned up with envy. The next week it would be
Africa, and after that London, and there we were
plowing through the sky to Kansas City, Des Moines
or Peoria. And now,” she breathed, “we are on our
way to China by way of Africa, India, and all the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>“We!” Janet exclaimed. “Do they expect just you
and me to fly the Atlantic, alone?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” Mary asked, teasingly. “Oh, well—”
she added, “Sparky told me tonight that he and I
would go on alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nice going,” Janet’s tone was a trifle cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Janet!” Mary put out a hand. “Don’t look
at it that way. There’s something aboard the Lone
Star that just has to go through. I wish I could tell
you what it is. I can’t because I don’t know. Naturally,
it’s better that a man pilot the plane, one who
has flown the Atlantic many times. It would be natural,
too, that Don should go if he were able, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, sure!” Janet was her old, friendly self again.
“I understand. We’ll have to get Don to a hospital
somewhere and I’ll stay to see him through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and you may get to China yet, both of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, China,” Janet yawned. “Just now I’d love
to find myself on Broadway in little, old New York,
with a run to Denver waiting for me in the morning.
It’s a funny world, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It certainly is,” Mary agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>At one A.M. Sparky climbed down from the Lone
Star’s cabin. “Go on up there and sleep,” was his
gruff but kindly order. “We’ve got a tough day
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They obeyed. While Janet wrapped herself up
in blankets, Mary spread out an eiderdown robe her
father had once brought from the far North, and
they were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>Three hours later, just as the moon was nearing
the crest of the ridge, lying off to the west, Mary
crept down from the plane to join Sparky in his
vigil.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don still asleep?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure is. He’s lucky to be able to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps he’s not so badly injured after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bad enough,” Sparky sighed. “We’ll have to get
him over to the hospital at Para. Then you and I’ll
have to hop the little channel that lies between
South America and Africa. Your cargo must go
through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Secret cargo!” she whispered. “Wonder what it
could be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some new weapons for destroying Japs perhaps.
A new type of sub-machine gun, or just a badly
needed medicine for the soldiers up there in Burma.
They say it’s plenty bad up there this time of year.
Anyway, that secret cargo must go through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ours’ not to reason why—‘ours’ but to do and
die,” she parodied.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>“Who knows!” His voice sounded solemn in the
stillness of the night. “The enemy has our number.
I’ve been looking at my motors. They’ve been tampered
with, emery dust in the pistons or something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where could that have happened!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Caracas!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But there were soldiers guarding every plane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Soldiers of foreign lands are sometimes traitors.
So, too, are mechanics who tune up the motors.
We’ll have to be on our guard every moment. This
time we were over the land. The next it may be the
sea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll watch,” she vowed. “Day and night. Night
and day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it’s all so strange,” she mused after a time.
“Why should there be a sudden demand for so many
big planes in China?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are rumors of a plan to bomb Tokio.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I’d like to be in on that!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wouldn’t we all! But it’s just a rumor. I’ve
heard that we are to attack Burma from two sides.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Try to re-capture the Burma Road?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would be glorious!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’ve heard the Japs are going after Russia
and that these bombers are for our Russian allies.
All these are rumors. We may never know the truth.
That’s the way it is in war.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>For a time after that nothing but the low rush of
the river and the croaking of the ‘Why’ frog disturbed
the silence of the jungle. Then, suddenly,
Mary whispered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Singing,” Sparky whispered back after a tense
moment. “Natives on the river.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moon has gone behind the hills. They’re
coming back. The natives are coming.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and let them come,” Sparky rattled his sub-machine
gun. “If they’re peaceful, things will be all
right. If not—” He rattled the gun once more.
“This is war. The Lone Star and her secret cargo
must go through!”</p>

<p class='c012'>After that for some time they sat there in silence
listening to the wild native chant that, with every
movement, grew louder.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, suddenly, the dark waters of the river came
all alight. The long canoes had turned a bend of the
river. In each canoe were a dozen torches held aloft.
Mary counted nine canoes in all. To her heightened
imagination each canoe seemed a hundred feet in
length.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do they come like that when they want to fight?”
she asked gripping Sparky’s arm hard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who knows?” was the brief reply.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap03' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER III</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>BATTLING A SPY</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>For a time Sparky and Mary sat in the dark silently
watching the torch-lit procession of great canoes.
To Mary it was a fascinating and fearsome
spectacle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Sparky let out a low exclamation.
“Thunderation!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that he jumped from the log on which he had
been sitting to kick at their half-burned-out campfire
until the coals glowed red again. Then, gathering
up an armful of dry-as-tinder leaves, he threw
them on the coals.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a space of seconds a column of dense smoke
rose straight toward the stars. Then, as the whole
mass burst into flames, all about them, the native
huts, the airplanes, and the jungle at their backs
stood out in bold relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” Mary exclaimed, shrinking back. “Why
did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll meet any man half way,” was the reply.
“That is, anyone but Hitler’s mob and those dirty,
little Japs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But those men are savages!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>“Who knows? What’s a savage anyway,” Sparky’s
voice sounded strange. “Every man is a human being.
Those are men. Brazil is our ally at war and
this is Brazil. When men come to you singing and
waving torches, you just must meet them half way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time the dugout canoes were pulling up to
the shore. The chant had ceased. In its place was
only the murmur of voices. The torches still flamed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon a procession came moving like a great,
twisting, glowing serpent toward the campfire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” Mary crowded close. “It’s too much.
I can’t stand it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Steady, girl!” Sparky’s voice was calm. His hands
still gripped the tommy-gun.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the procession came closer, they saw that most
of the natives were all but naked, that some carried
rifles and others spears and that they were led by a
little man wearing striped trousers, a bright jacket
and a sword. They did not pause until, as if in a
high-school drill, they had ranged themselves in
three semicircular rows before the fire. The little
man stood at the center and three steps before them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary tried to think what one swing of Sparky’s
spitting tommy-gun would do to those rows and
shuddered.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last the little man spoke. His words came in
slow, precise English.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are from the United States?”</p>

<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>“That’s right, pardner,” Sparky agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The United States and Brazil are united against
a common enemy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As our ally I salute you.” The little man’s hand
shot up in a salute.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thrilled to her fingertips, Mary managed to join
Sparky in a salute.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little man spoke a single word in a strange
tongue and instantly the circle of natives dropped to
their knees in a position of ease.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just like that,” Mary whispered. She wanted terribly
to cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a courteous gesture the little man invited
Mary and Sparky to resume their positions on the
log. Then he sat down at Sparky’s side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I,” he said, “am Doctor Salazar. I have studied
in your country. Being not unskilled in the medical
profession and also possessed of an interest in native
life, I was sent to this place that I might make
friends of the natives. This, you will see, I’ve done.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are wonderful,” Mary exclaimed. “And you
are a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that is my profession.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One member of our party has been injured, how
seriously we can’t tell,” Sparky explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am at your service. Shall we have a look at
this man?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>They rose and walked over to Don’s side. He had
been sleeping but now stared at them with questioning
eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have brought you a doctor,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And not a medicine man either,” Sparky
laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>With practised fingers the little man went over
Don from head to toe. “No bones broken,” was his
diagnosis. “Probably three ribs cracked. When his
chest is taped up, he can be moved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good! We’ll take him to Para in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In that large plane, I suppose,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the other plane?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If your men will help us, we can load the motors
in our good plane,” said Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It shall be done. You are Americans. I am an
American. We all are Americans.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re right. We all are!” Mary exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The motors shall go,” said the doctor. “But that
which remains?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky shrugged. “In a war there will always be
losses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My men and I can take it in pieces. We shall
float it to the Rio Negro. There it can be put on a
steamer. It should be in Para perhaps in two weeks.
So there you are.” The doctor made another bow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, you are wonderful!” Mary exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>“It is all for the great cause. Speed the victory.”
The doctor clicked his heels and saluted.</p>

<p class='c012'>The salute was returned in good measure.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so it was arranged. Scarcely had the red of
dawn disappeared from the sky when the Lone Star
rose to greet the sun, then began winging its way
toward the far-away city of Para.</p>

<p class='c012'>Four hours later, far above the clouds, they flew
across the broad waters of the Para river at its mouth,
then began circling down to the city of Para.</p>

<p class='c012'>First to catch Mary’s eye was the city’s ancient fortifications.
As they circled lower she caught the
gleam of the cathedral’s roof. The governor’s palace
and other public buildings stood out from among
the royal palms. Last but not least were the hundreds
of homes, each with its lovely little garden
surrounded by palms.</p>

<p class='c012'>The broad public garden caught her eye, then the
airport. So they came circling down to ask for and
receive permission to land.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as they were down an ambulance was
called and Don, with Janet in attendance, was
whisked away to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m staying with the ship,” Sparky said to Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure,” Mary agreed. “Can’t take any chances
this time.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>“That’s right. Besides there’s a lot to be done.
The motors from my ship must be unloaded and arrangements
made for the repairing and assembling
of the other plane when it arrives—if it does,”
Sparky added gloomily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! It will!” Mary exclaimed. “I’d trust that
little doctor with my life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay. We’ll hope for it,” Sparky agreed. “You
just hop out somewhere and get yourself a good,
square meal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One good Brazilian feed,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it. One dinner in every land. That’s our
motto.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll bring you a dinner on a tray, buy tray, dishes,
and all. When we get going you can eat the food
and throw the dishes into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be taking off in just a couple of hours, if I
can get our papers all cleared up, so don’t admire
the scenery too long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t worry. I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Even at this strange corner of the world the war
was much in evidence. Soldiers were all over the
field. Army planes from many lands came and went.
At the gate stood two guards. A smile and her uniform
were all the passes she needed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not so the youth in tattered clothes who stood
outside the gate, gazing in at Mary’s big plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s some plane you’ve got.” He tipped his
seedy hat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re an American, too.” She smiled.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>“Yes—I—guess so. At least I used to be.” He did
not smile. “Now, well, I guess you’d say I’m sort of
a tropical tramp. Been down here for five years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” his voice rose, “Boy! That plane of yours.
Must be the best there is!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ever do any flying?” she asked. She should be
going on but this boy interested her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure—I’ve flown quite a bit, here and in U.S.A.,
too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why don’t you join up?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your outfit?” He grinned broadly. “You’re a
girl.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but there are a lot more men than women
flying for the Ferry Command.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But then,” her voice dropped, “they probably
wouldn’t take you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?” His shoulders squared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s just it,” was the quick reply. “You’re too
fit. They’d want you for combat duty. You can’t
make our outfit unless you’re too old for combat or
there’s something a little wrong with you. Sparky,
my fellow-pilot, has a hole in his eardrum. Combat
wouldn’t take him, but Ferry did.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But say!” She gave him a good, square look.
“Why don’t you ship back to U.S.A. and get into a
uniform? Afraid to go back?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, just ashamed. I ran away. My mother’s a
peach. She really is.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>“Go back and sign up. Get into uniform, then
breeze back home. You’ll make a hit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>He broke short off to leap sideways, take three flying
steps, then swing his arm to knock something
from a stranger’s hand. Without knowing why,
Mary followed on the run. It was lucky that she did,
for the angry man flashed a knife. He slashed at the
boy once and drew blood. His second blow, better
aimed, might have been fatal had not Mary done a
flying leap to knock his arm high in the air and send
the knife flying away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly they were surrounded by soldiers. The
youth and the man were seized. Two soldiers
stepped toward Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What eez zis all about?” one asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I really don’t know,” was her faltering answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>The soldier looked at her in astonishment. “You
might have been keeled. Now you say, ‘I know
nothing.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a fact for all that.” She smiled in spite of
herself. “I—I do things like that sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll tell you what it’s about,” the boy broke in,
holding up a bloody arm. “That man,” he pointed
to the stranger, “is a spy. He was taking pictures of
that big plane. That’s an American plane and I’m
an American. He can’t get by with that!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>“Good for you!” The words were on Mary’s lips.
She did not say them. Instead she bent down and
picked up something black that gave off a bright
gleam. “He’s telling the truth,” she said in as quiet
a tone as she could command. “Here’s the proof, his
camera. That boy knocked it from his hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a lie!” the man snarled. “I never saw the
thing before!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s one of those costly miniature cameras,” Mary
went on. “It takes a hundred pictures as easy as firing
a machine gun. And sometimes it’s twice as
deadly.” She handed it to the soldier. “Have the
film developed. The pictures will speak for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a lie,” the man growled, trying to break
away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He calls himself Joe Stevens now,” said the boy,
swabbing his bleeding arm with a soiled handkerchief.
“I knew him in Manos. That was before we
entered the war. He was a rubber trader then.
They called him Schnieder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll look into this,” said the officer.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Mary he said, “This boy needs attention.
There’s a Red Cross first-aid station up that way a
block.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll have him fixed up,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And will you vouch for his return to the station
at the airport gate?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on then,” the soldier spoke to Stevens who
had once been Schnieder, then they marched away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s nothing,” the boy said, hiding his hand. “I’ll
fix it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Mary. “We’re going to the first-aid station.
Then you’re going to take me to some place
where I can get a swell dinner.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, so that’s how it is?” His face lit up. “Come
on, then, let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>An hour later, with his arm neatly bandaged, the
boy sat opposite her, smiling. The grand dinner he
had promised was coming to an end. It had been all
she had dreamed of and more. They were having
their black coffee and ice cream.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking a pencil from her purse she wrote on a
card then handed it to him. “That,” she said, “is
my permanent address. I’m going on a rather long
journey. I may not come back. We never know.
But if I do, I’d like to have something nice waiting
for me. Send me your picture when you get in uniform,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I—” He swallowed hard. “Yes, I will, if I
make it.” That was all he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the airport gate he put out a hand for a good
stout handclasp.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ships that pass in the night.” His voice was
husky.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>“Yes,” she replied quickly. “Fighting ships that
are going to put things to rights in this old world of
ours.” At that she turned to march away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the way,” he called after her. “Just in case
you might like to know, my name’s Jerry Sikes—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, Jerry.” She smiled. Then without
thinking she added, “I’ll be seeing you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One more hour passed. Just as they were ready to
take off, Mary brought Sparky his dinner on a tray.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s paid for, tray and all,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good! Then, let’s go.” He led the way into
the cabin. “They say it brings good luck if you
throw your dishes into the sea,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary did not laugh. One word Sparky had spoken
stuck in her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Luck,” she whispered to herself. “We may need
it, all kinds of luck.” She could not quite forget
that they had already lost one plane. Just now she
had visions of herself on a rubber raft in mid-Atlantic,
casting a line in the vain hope of catching a fish.</p>

  <h2 id='chap04' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IV</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>THE BIG HOP</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>Shaking herself free from these disturbing
thoughts, Mary checked the No. 1 card Sparky
handed her and said, “It’s okay,” then watched him
check his gas.</p>

<p class='c012'>Working together like the well-trained team that
they were, they threw on a switch here to release it,
then snapped on another there, only to reach for one
more switch. Mary nodded to the mechanic waiting
outside. He nodded back, then held up a fire bottle.
One engine coughed, then the other. Mary reached
for two small levers, Sparky eased the throttle back
to one thousand, then nodded to the mechanic. The
mechanic removed the chocks from before their
wheels. Sparky eased his plane slowly down the runway.
They picked up speed. Faster—faster—faster
they sped and then that magic word, “up,” and they
were away.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were not off for Africa, not yet. Their way
led along the coast toward Natal, the jumping off
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes they were far out over the sea and then
again the beauty of tropical forests lay beneath them.
It was a glorious trip.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>Just at sunset a white spot appeared before them
and Mary knew that this lap of their journey was
nearing its end.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are good American mechanics at Natal,”
Sparky said. “They’ll give the old ship a real going
over. We’ll get a few hours of good, sound sleep.
And then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be off.” Mary thrilled to the tips of her
toes. “Off for the Old World. We’re going abroad,
Sparky! Just think! Really going abroad!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s just another trip for me,” Sparky laughed
low. “But if you get a kick out of it, that’s just fine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get a kick out of it!” she exclaimed. “Of course
I will. If the time ever comes when I no longer get
a kick out of things, I’ll be ready to die.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Guess you’re right at that,” Sparky agreed. “But
then, what’s a thrill to you may be just another headache
for someone else. I, too, have my big moments.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me know when you have one?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might, at that,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a good little hotel run just for American
women at Natal,” he said. “Run by an old lady
called Aunt Polly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aunt Polly—sounds like a parrot,” Mary
laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’s got one, too,” said Sparky. “She keeps a
nice place. I’ll run over there soon’s we land.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>“Set your alarm, for I’ll be after you at two A.M.
We’ll not sleep going over so don’t lie awake thinking.
Hit the pillow fast and hard. That’s my motto.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fast and hard it shall be,” Mary agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that they began circling for a landing.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At 2:15 that night they had breakfast sitting on
stools in a little all-night stand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lots of coffee and plenty of oatmeal with cream,”
was Mary’s order.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And good, brown toast with well-done bacon,”
Sparky added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nervous?” he asked as her fingers shook a bit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s fine. I wouldn’t give a plugged nickel
for a partner that didn’t have nerves. It’s part of our
equipment. Keeps us on our toes. But you’re not
scared?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just a little.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be!” He grinned. “It’s only a step.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pretty long step.” She smiled back at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eighteen hundred miles, plus, and water under
us all the way. What could be sweeter? And we’ll
be flying out to meet the dawn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Sparky!” she exclaimed. “That does sound
swell! I never did like night. Just to think that
we’re hurrying away to meet the sun that is just
popping along to meet us! That sure is something.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>The food was excellent so she ordered a lunch “to
go” and, producing a gallon thermos bottle, ordered
it filled with coffee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Sparky, “will be frozen solid. We’re
going to be flying up there among the stars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, it won’t,” she gave him a sly smile.
“There are some advantages in having a gal for a co-pilot.
One of the advantages is a hot lunch half way
across.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tasting is believing.” He was a skeptic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten minutes later they were at the airport and
with their arrival a burden seemed to fall upon
Mary’s slender shoulders. She had started out light-heartedly
enough to do, with her companion, Janet,
what no woman of the Ferry Command had ever
done before, to ferry a big ship half way round the
world. What was more, their ship was to carry a
light cargo of vital war equipment. Now her companion
was gone. Sparky had taken her place. They
had started out forty planes strong. Now one plane
was out of action and thirty-eight were a full day
ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll have to go it alone,” she said, speaking
half to herself and half to Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it,” Sparky agreed. “The Fates have arranged
that.”</p>

<p><i>“We’ll Have to Go It Alone,” Said Mary</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>“And our cargo is priceless. That’s what the Major
said.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Priceless,” he agreed. “It’s quite as important
that it should arrive safely as, well perhaps, as it is
for all those big bombers ahead of us to go through.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Mary,” his voice changed, “don’t think of
it that way. You’ll tighten up if you do. That might
prove fatal. You have to be relaxed, flexible, ready
for anything. That’s how you have to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I’ll try to forget that cargo,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he breathed, “here’s our ship all primed
up and rarin’ to go. Come on. Let’s climb up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again he handed her the “Form One” card.
This time she studied it with supreme care. It told
her that the engines were in perfect order, that the
tubes of carbon dioxide snow for fire prevention
were full as were their oxygen tubes, and that fuel
and oil supply were at their maximum.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she had studied the card, she nodded to
Sparky, and at once, he began thumbing the oil gage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you always check your oil supply?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Always,” was the emphatic reply, “regardless of
the report on the card, test your fuel. If you want to
keep on living, you’ll always do that. Men are human.
An attendant may read your report, note that
your No. 1 tank is short a hundred gallons, record
that he is putting that amount in, then discover that
he has but fifty gallons to spare. He forgets to record
the change and—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>“Right out over an endless forest your engine
coughs and dies. No gas—I see,” she replied soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gas and oil okay,” Sparky murmured. Then in
silence he flipped on the ignition and gas, set the
electric primer going, counted five, allowed it to
snap off, then nodded to his mechanic. The mechanic
grinned as he held up a carbon-dioxide fire
extinguisher.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s one more thing,” Sparky warned. “Don’t
ever start twin motors unless someone is near with
the fire bottle. And don’t you let me do it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that so bad?” Mary asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Worst in the world,” Sparky exploded. “If one
motor fails to start popping, you’ll have a fire in
your exhaust pipe.... A fire bottle will put it out in
a hurry. But if there’s no fire bottle your ship will
go up in smoke. A fire of high octane gas is something
to think about!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He started the energizing wheel going, waited a
space of seconds, then threw on the fuel-booster
switch. First the right engine began coughing. Mary
worked her two levers that enriched the fuel mixture.
Sparky eased his throttle back to one thousand,
then nodded to the mechanic. The mechanic
removed the chocks from before the wheels, and the
big ship started to move.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’re off!” Mary thought with a little choking
sensation at her throat.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>Sparky cursed some small, foreign plane that,
taxiing across the field, caused him to swing sharply
to the right.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Looks like he did that on purpose,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“May have, at that,” was the reply. “There are
some Hitler sympathizers down this way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he sighed ten seconds later. “I fooled
him. Now the runway’s clear, so here we go.” The
powerful motors roared in unison. They rose
sharply toward the stars. Ten minutes later they
were out over the blue-black sea and still slowly
climbing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The sea is so black,” Mary thought. “The sky is
all filled with night. Hours of this! How can I bear
it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as a sense of real joy, the feeling that must
come to a night-flying bird, passed over her, she
whispered, “But we’re rushing east to meet the
dawn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get on your oxygen mask,” Sparky commanded,
crashing into her dream. “We’re going up where
there isn’t any weather and mighty little air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their masks were attached by rubber tubes to
pipes running from the oxygen storage tanks. When
Mary had pulled on her mask she sighed, “Ah!
That’s great! Isn’t it wonderful that they should
mould our masks to fit our faces!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>“It’s a grand idea,” Sparky agreed, “but you’ll get
tired enough of it before we greet that dawn of
yours. We’re going up to twenty thousand feet and
stay there for hours. We’ll make better time that
way and there’ll be no bumps. You can even sleep
if you want to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sleep!” Mary’s voice rose. “I’d never do that.
Suppose you fell asleep, or—or something happened
to you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never get sleepy and nothing ever happens.”
Sparky settled back in his place. “Talk when you
feel like it,” he drawled. “I like the sound of your
voice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you do,” Mary laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>They climbed to twenty thousand feet. It seemed
to Mary that she could feel the intense cold creeping
through their cabin’s walls and her four-inch-thick
suit of wool, leather and fur. But this, she knew, was
pure imagination.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they zoomed along through the blue with the
black ocean far below and the stars apparently scattered
all about them, she felt very little desire to
talk. She just wanted to think.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her mind went back to childhood days. Happy
days they had been, those days with her father.
School shut out much of this. And then had come
college. College vacations found her flying, first with
her father, then alone. She had learned about airplane
engines from the ground up and had even become
an expert with a machine gun.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>“That,” she told herself, “was Providence, a dress
rehearsal for war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As if he had been reading her thoughts, Sparky
said, “Mary, there were a dozen or more who volunteered
for this job you’re doing now. I wouldn’t
want you to think I don’t like your work. I do.
You’re swell, but how come they picked on you?
You’re about the youngest of the lot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right,” Mary agreed, “but I’ve had more
hours of solo flight than any of them. Fifteen hundred,
to be exact.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fifteen hundred?” Sparky whistled. “Practically
flew from your cradle!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nope—started when I was sixteen. You see, Dad
is as much at home in the air as on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you take after him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure. Why not? What’s more, I know a lot about
airplane engines and machine guns.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Handy man with tools, eh?” Sparky drawled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Try me.” Mary did not laugh. “Who knows?
This job of ours may call for all the tricks we know
before it’s done.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Guess that’s right,” Sparky agreed. “And I sure
am glad you’re on the job.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>After that they once more lapsed into silence.
The miles and the stars flew by. There were times
when Mary was plagued by the illusion that somehow
their ship had stopped traveling, that they were
there, suspended in space, their motors roaring, but
taking them nowhere. At such times she felt an all
but over-powering desire to scream, for her overwrought
imagination was telling her that the motors
would roar on until the fuel was gone, then they
would crash into the sea.</p>

<p class='c012'>At times she felt drowsy, at others she was so wide
awake that she wanted to leave her seat for a walk.
This she knew was not entirely impossible since a
bottle of oxygen attached to her tube and slung over
her shoulder would give her freedom of movement.
But this would call for more exertion than she felt
like, and she lapsed back into sleepiness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, little by little, she found herself drifting
into a light and hilarious mood. She wanted to sing.
She did hum little snatches of funny songs she knew.
“The Bear Went Over The Mountain,” “The Old
Gray Mare, She Ain’t What She Used To Be,” and
“Clementine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From time to time Sparky looked at her and
growled into his mask.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Sparky,” she cried at last, “I’m tired of this
mask. Can’t I take it off?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She meant this only as a joke but Sparky roared,
“For heaven’s sake! No! You wouldn’t last half a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>Nothing daunted, she told him a rather long,
funny story.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that supposed to be a joke?” he growled. “If
so, where’s the point?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She began to realize that something was wrong.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Either Sparky has turned into a terrible crab or
I’m plain crazy,” she told herself half in despair.</p>

<p class='c012'>From hilarity she went into gloomy foreboding.
Then, of a sudden, she sprang out of both. She knew
what had happened. Both she and Sparky were
drunk on oxygen. They had been up high too long.
They should drop to lower levels at once. But how
was she ever to make Sparky see this? In the morose
mood of a partially intoxicated man, he would perhaps
resist all her suggestions.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a moment’s thought she believed she had
the very idea. “Sparky,” she said, “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suck your thumb, like a bear,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The coffee’s hot, a whole gallon of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s frozen solid. I told you it would be. Know
what the temperature outside is? Thirty-five below.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know, but that coffee’s still hot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s my secret.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then keep it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll bet you five dollars it’s hot, yes, and the bottle
of soup, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>“You got five dollars?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure I have.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All—all right, it’s a bet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure it is. Do come on down to five thousand
feet and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay, here we go. But I get the five.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They started down. Anxiously Mary watched the
recording gage. Twenty thousand, fifteen thousand,
ten, eight—she opened a ventilator, then another.
At five thousand they leveled off. When at last the
air was changed, they dragged off their masks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whew!” Sparky breathed deeply. “That’s great!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t know half of it,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where’s your hot coffee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll get it.” She did. When the cork was removed
steam rose from the bottle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I’ll be!” Sparky exclaimed. “You win!
How do you do it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Little electric heat, that’s all.” She pointed at
the connections at the base of the thermos bottle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say!” Sparky beamed. “From now on, you and
I travel together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least for some little time,” she agreed with a
wise smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a grand little lunch they enjoyed there
above the black waters of the Atlantic. Mary flew
the ship while Sparky drank hot coffee and soup,
and munched hot cheese sandwiches. Then he took
the controls while she carried on with the lunch
box.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>But when it was all over and they began once
more to climb, weighty problems once more bore
down upon Mary’s tired brain. Would they again
climb high and fly too far, then become oxygen-drunk
again? She hated to ask Sparky and yet—</p>

<p class='c012'>Thousands of weary miles lay ahead, miles where
danger lurked all the way. Then, too, there was
their precious cargo. Would it reach its destination
safely?</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must,” she whispered. She reached for her
mask and then Sparky spoke.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  <h2 id='chap05' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER V</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>THE LADY IN BLACK</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“Forget the mask,” Sparky was saying. “We’ve
got loads of gas. Dawn will soon be here. We’ll stay
five thousand feet. Go back and get a little rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Reluctantly she obeyed. Having wrapped herself
in the eiderdown robe, she fell fast asleep. But not
for long. She awoke with a start from a disturbing
dream to find an eerie light shining down upon her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ship’s on fire!” she thought tumbling out of
her robe.</p>

<p class='c012'>She sprang to a window to whisper, “We have met
the dawn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was true. The sun, a red disk, rolled along the
horizon. The sea and the sky were all ablaze with
light.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” she exclaimed. “It’s wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it?” he asked sleepily. “Just another sunrise.
That’s all it seems to be. But look, Mary, you’ve
been a peach. I suppose I should apologize for being
gruff with you back there when we were way up
high.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>“Oh, no!” Mary exclaimed. “Don’t ever apologize.
Your friends don’t demand it, your enemies
don’t deserve it. Besides I never quarrel with people
when they’re drunk.” A teasing smile played about
the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who’s been drunk?” He shot her a quick look.
“You think I’m crazy? I’m not a drinking man, but
if I were, I’d be plain mad if I drank before a trip
like this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! So you weren’t drunk?” She threw back
her head for a good laugh. “You were all the same.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What!” Sparky seemed ready to leave the controls
to crown her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, you were drunk and so was I. I was happy
and you were sad. That’s how people get when they
are drunk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say, are you crazy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Sparky, I’m not.” She laughed again. “We
were having an oxygen drunk. It might have been
dangerous. I realized the danger just in time. Too
much oxygen, too long, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Too much oxygen, too long,” he repeated after
her. “I’ve heard of that happening but just think of
an oldtimer like me getting caught with it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The bigger they are the harder they fall.” She
favored him with a good laugh. “But it’s not really
strange,” she added soberly. “Our trip, this far, has
been a hard one. You’ve worked long hours. You
were too tired to think. I was fresh. That made all
the difference. And just for that, how would you
like to crawl back for a few winks?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>“Don’t mind if I do.” He offered her the controls.
“But promise me that if anything unusual occurs,
seaplanes show up, or anything like that, you’ll call
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll call you,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky’s sleep was long and peaceful. Never had
Mary enjoyed herself half so much as on that morning
guiding the big ship through the blue sky over
a sea as dark and mysterious as death.</p>

<p class='c012'>An hour passed, two, three hours. Sometimes she
wondered in a vague sort of way about their secret
cargo. Would it go through safely and would she be
with the ship to its journey’s end? Just then none of
these things appeared to matter much. It was good
to live. That, for the moment, was enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a spring-like warmth in the air, and a
faint fragrance as of flowers. They were going
against a mild off-shore breeze.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once she spotted dark dots on the ocean far below.
There were twenty-four, a convoy. It must,
she told herself, be an American convoy. She wanted
terribly to drop down low and dip a wing in salute
but, this, she knew, would never do. Some enemy
sub might see that dip and know that the convoy
lay beneath her. They would close in and then—</p>

<p class='c012'>No—it would never do, so she drove straight on
toward the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>At last a long, low, gray-green cloud appeared on
the horizon before her. Or was it a cloud? Breathing
softly she waited and watched. The long, narrow
line widened. It seemed to take form. Some spots
were higher, some strips greener than others. At
last she whispered excitedly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s land! Land! Africa! I’ll soon be abroad.
The long hop is nearing its end.” She wanted to
shout for joy, to scream, but this she knew was not
expected of the co-pilot of a big ship so all she said
was:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Sparky! Wake up! We’re nearing land,
and I don’t know the way to that secret airfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What—what?” Sparky groaned sleepily. “It can’t
be land. I just stretched out here a minute ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know.” Mary laughed for sheer joy. “It’s
land all the same. I think I see a camel. Come and
see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky came forward rubbing his eyes. Adjusting
his glasses he took a good look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t make out your camel,” he drawled, “but
that white spot off to the right is Dakar, all right.
Good girl! You hit it right on the nose. Give me
the controls and I’ll have you eating fried camel
steak and dates before the hour is up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They did just that. Coming down on an airfield
fringed with palms, they were given a cordial greeting
by a dozen good American soldiers. To a man,
they stared at Mary, then grinning, saluted.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>“Jeepers, boys!” one of them exclaimed. “An
honest-to-goodness lady of the Ferry Command.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If they all come like this one, make ’em all ladies
from now on,” his buddy chipped in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s nice to see you all.” Mary put on her best
smile. “I only wish I could be with you for a week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Make it two! Make it for the duration!” came
in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two hours,” was Sparky’s pronouncement.
“Give our ship the once-over, will you, while we
motor in for some chow?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, sure, we’ll fix her up fine,” a big sergeant
grinned. “But you’ll have to do your own searching
for stowaways.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And be sure you look well!” the lieutenant in
charge added. “I’m short-handed. Can’t spare a
man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>An army jeep appeared and they were whisked
away to a small city of low, white buildings, gleaming
streets, and many camels.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My!” Mary exclaimed. “It’s hot!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure!” said Sparky. “This is Africa.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The scene shifts so fast I can’t keep up,” Mary
said, fanning herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It won’t be bad in here,” said Sparky, motioning
her to enter a long, low eating place. “It’s more
than half American, patronized mostly by our
people. They run a sort of concession and get real
food supplies from America.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>The place was all open screened windows. There
was a breeze from the sea. The food was good, even
to the coffee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just think of taking off in two hours!” Mary exclaimed.
“I’d like to make it two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure,” Sparky grinned. “Great place for a gal.
Hundred American soldiers to pick from.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Forget it!” She was half inclined to be
angry. “What I mean is, I’d like really to see these
places we visit, not go to it hop-skip-jump. It—it
seems such a waste.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right,” Sparky agreed. “After the war
we’ll do it all over—take a whole year for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will we?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who knows?” He spoke slowly. “We may be
dead. This is war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky hurried through the meal, then excused
himself. “Gotta see about our papers,” he explained.
“Be back in 'bout half an hour. Get yourself another
cup of java and wait here in the shade.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hardly had Sparky disappeared when a tall, distinguished-looking
young woman entered. She was
dressed in a striking manner, all in black, yet it was
not the black of mourning for she wore much bright
costume jewelry.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>The place was fairly empty, a native couple in one
corner and two doughboys in another.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you mind?” The woman indicated the chair
Sparky had left. “One sees so few women here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary did not mind. The woman, who spoke with
a French accent, took a seat, then ordered cakes and
sour wine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are from America?” the woman suggested.
Mary nodded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A lady soldier?” Mary shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But your uniform?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In America many women wear uniforms. We
like them.” Mary smiled. “I happen to be a member
of the Ferry Command.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you flew a big plane all the way! How
wonderful! Shall there be many more of you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—I—” Mary broke off. She had been about
to say, “I may be the only one. Mine is a special
mission.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a fool I am,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I came for the ride really,” she said, covering up
deftly. “My father is over here somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! You brave Americans!” the woman exclaimed.
“They saved my country, France, in the
last war and now—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you expect us to do it again,” Mary wanted
to say. “And over here you are divided. You don’t
really know what you want.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>She did not say this, nor did the woman finish,
for at that moment a bright-eyed young woman in
khaki entered the place and walked straight to their
table to ask:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you Mary Mason?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.” Mary stood up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve been asked to speak to you—that, that is I
have a message for you.” The girl seemed embarrassed.
“Perhaps—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! No!” The French woman was on her feet.
“I have urgent business. I was about to go. It is
good to have seen you—” She bowed to Mary and
was gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you forgive me.” The girl in khaki dropped
into a seat. “I just had to do it. I never saw that
woman before. She may be all right. You never
know. Over here half the people are for us, the
other half against. You dare trust no one. You
didn’t—” She hesitated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t tell her a thing worth knowing.” Mary
smiled. “Will you have a cup of coffee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, sure!” The other girl’s face beamed. “Real
American girls are so rare here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a WAC?” Mary suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, of course. There are very few of us here
now, but there will be more and more.” Her voice
dropped. “That’s the sort of things they want to
know,” she confided in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>They talked, sipped coffee, and munched cakes
until Sparky hurried into the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All set!” he exclaimed. “Our outfit is still far
ahead of us. Got to get going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After Mary had introduced Lucy Merriman, the
WAC, they were on their way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be seeing you,” Mary called back. Then she
added in an undertone, “I wonder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As she climbed into the car, she caught a glimpse
of the tall French woman. She was talking to a small
man with a round face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s a queer-looking pair,” said Sparky. “Lady
of quality and a beggar Arab.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He looks like a Jap,” Mary gave the fellow a
sharp look. She would know him if she saw him
again. “Besides,” she added, “he can’t be quite a
beggar. He’s got a camel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You meet all types here,” Sparky replied absently.
“It’s the strangest country you ever may hope
to see. We’ve sure got to watch our step. By rights
we should fly square across the desert. But with our
cargo,” his voice dropped, “it’s too risky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So we’ll go northeast?” Mary suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That takes us into fighting country?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—sort of—”</p>

<p class='c012'>The car started, returning them to the airfield.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>“There’s a secret airport, on an oasis,” Sparky told
Mary. “That’ll be our first stop. After that we hit
Egypt and another secret spot. Egypt is safe enough.
It’s those miles in between.” His brow wrinkled in
a frown. “But we’ll make it.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap06' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VI</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>MYSTERIOUS MOSLEM</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>To Mary the next lap in their long journey will
always remain a blank, but the oasis at which they
arrived will stand out vividly in her memory.</p>

<p class='c012'>The reason for the blank was quite simple, for,
as soon as they were safely in the air, Sparky said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mary, you look tired. I know you are tough as a
hickory limb and you’ve got all kinds of grit—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, thanks, Sparky,” she grinned. “I’m glad
you’ve got my number.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Got your number!” Sparky exploded. “Of
course I have and just now you need sleep. That
secret cargo of ours won’t wait and so—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Tell me what our secret cargo is,” she
begged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you stop interrupting me?” he stormed.
“How do I know what it is? That’s a military secret.
All I know is that China needs all the help we can
bring her, every bit! And that this cargo of ours is
of the greatest importance. I shouldn’t wonder,”
his voice dropped as if he were afraid someone were
listening, “I shouldn’t wonder if the enemy knows
it’s important. I got a warning to be on my guard
not an hour ago, and that goes for you as well. This
is a dangerous land. It’s all full of Italians, wild
natives, and even a few traitorous Frenchmen that
would sell us out for a dime or kill us just for fun.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>“And so—” He paused for breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so—” Mary prompted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s see, where was I?” Sparky pulled back the
stick to climb a bit. “Oh, yes! And so we’ve just got
to keep right on flying. Mighty little time for sleep.
I had a dandy rest before we hit Africa. Now it’s
your turn. I’ll do this lap. You just crawl back
there, roll up in your robe, and sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All too willingly Mary rolled up in her robe and
slept. When she awoke they were circling for a landing
at one of the most fascinating spots she had ever
known.</p>

<p class='c012'>Looking down upon it, as they were, from ten
thousand feet, it seemed a green carpet on an endless
gray floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“An oasis!” Mary whispered. “How beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and I shouldn’t wonder if those dark,
moving spots over there on the grasslands were giraffes
or maybe elephants.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and there’s a camel caravan just coming in,”
Mary exclaimed. “How long it is. Must be fifty
camels. And the shadows seem darker than the
camels. Oh! I wish we could stay a week!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>“Well, we can’t,” Sparky warned. “Few hours at
best. Our right engine isn’t acting properly. Has
to be tuned up for this desert air, I guess. That’ll
give you a breathing spell. Make the most of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The camel shadows on the desert were long. The
sun was almost down when at last their plane came
to rest on that long, narrow runway there in the
desert.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here again they found good American soldiers
and mechanics. And Mary once more found herself
creating a sensation!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hey, fellas!” one boy with bulging eyes shouted.
“It’s a lady, a lady pilot, right out here just a mile
beyond nowhere!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Joe! Hey, Jerry! You! Tom!” another called.
“Come and see it. We got lions an’ elephants, zebras,
giraffes, and aardvarks, but this one is different!
Come a-running! See if you can name it.” He
looked at Mary and laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were grand boys, all of them, and those who
were not on duty showed her the time of her life.
They hurried her off to mess where they feasted her
on ripe figs, bananas, strawberries, and all manner
of African delicacies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then one of them said, “Come on! We’ll show
you something you’ll never forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long will it take?” she demurred.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only an hour or two.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll have to ask Sparky about that.”</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>She found Sparky perspiring and covered with
grease as he worked with the mechanics tuning up
the engine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two hours,” was his short reply. “Be back in
two hours if you want to fly with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be back in an hour!” a boy from Indiana
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! Sure!” they all agreed. “Come on. What
are we waiting for? Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so away they all marched to the shelter where
the jeeps were kept.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was while on this march that Mary received a
sudden shock. As they hurried along, they met a
woman dressed as a Moslem woman always is. She
wore a long, flowing robe and her face, save for her
eyes, was covered with a veil. Yet there seemed to be
something very familiar about the tall, erect figure
and the brisk, springing walk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jeepers! I never saw her before!” a boy whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the same time Mary was thinking. “I must
have seen her somewhere. But how could I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then the dark eyes shining out from behind
the veil gave her a sharp, penetrating look. In her
shock Mary stumbled and nearly fell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can she be the woman who asked me questions
in that eating place, way back there in the little city
by the sea?” she asked herself. And then, “How
could it be?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>“Oh!” she exclaimed, stopping short. “I can’t go
with you boys. I must not!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aw, come on!” a boy from Texas begged. “You’ll
never see a thing like it again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We won’t be gone an hour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! Sure! You must come!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were such nice boys and she knew so well
what it must mean to be escorting a real American
girl in such a place, that she yielded and came along.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet, I shouldn’t do it,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before they were gone she received a second shock.
Just as they were all piling into the car, a small man
and a camel came shambling down the road.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can he be the little man I saw at the port?” she
asked herself. It gave her a shock to think that this
little man and the woman in black had somehow
made their way here before them. This thought, as
far as the little man was concerned, was short-lived.
When he had come closer she saw that he was shorter
than the other man, that his face was rounder, and
there was a scar across his left cheek. She heaved a
sigh on making this discovery, but her relief was
not to be of long duration.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so they rattled away, nine boys and a lady,
the first they had seen in many a day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shouldn’t have come,” Mary whispered to herself
once again. Had she but known it, she was to
be thinking that very thought hours later, and with
regrets.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>Darkness had come. Switching on the lights, they
went bumping over the sand ridges.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rides just like that big ship of yours, doesn’t it?”
said the boy from Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” said Mary, giggling like a kid. She was
happy but some sprite seemed to whisper, “Not
for long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After rattling along for a while with the lights on,
they snapped the lights off, but rattled straight on.</p>

<p class='c012'>A dark bulk loomed up before them. Shutting
off the gas, they, all but the driver, piled out and
began to push.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such crazy business,” Mary whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait and see,” came back to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last they came to a halt. The dark bulk was
closer now. Mary made out the forms of palm trees.
One of the boys was dragging something. Strange
sounds came from before them, low grunts, splashes,
then a loud trumpet-like sound that made Mary
jump.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say! What is this?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>Someone snapped on a spot light connected by a
wire to the car. Then she knew, for there before her,
like a set in a museum was a water hole and in the
water, belly-deep, stood all manner of creatures, ugly
rhinoceros, graceful gazelles, ungainly giraffes, huge
elephants and who could say what else.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>“Are they really alive?” she asked in an awed whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! What do you think?” The boy at her side
laughed. “We got ’em trained now. You should
have seen ’em the first time!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, an’ heard ’em,” another laughed low. “They
spilled all the water getting out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s about all the fun we have way out here,” one
boy added with a touch of sorrow. “Oh, gee! Why
don’t you stay with us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d love to,” said Mary, “but I’ve got a job to do.
There’s a war on, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And don’t we know it,” the boy whispered. “One
night we were bombed. Two boys were killed and
three went to the hospital. Gee! Just think of dying
way out here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary was thinking.</p>

<p class='c012'>By and by she whispered, “We’d better go back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without a word they turned about to go shuffling
back to the car. “Thanks a lot for coming with us,”
one of the boys shouted when they unloaded at the
airport.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! Sure!” they shouted. “Hope you come
this way again!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be seeing you,” she called. Then with a lump
in her throat she walked to the plane where the men
were just replacing the motor.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>Did she see a shadow dart away from the other
wing of the plane? It was too dark really to know.
“Probably a sneaking old jackal,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” she said as they soared aloft some time
later, “I’m going to resign from this job of mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then what?” Sparky asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’m going from place to place in all these
lonely spots cheering up the boys.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Sparky, “would be a noble purpose,
but just now you’re bound to this big plane and me.
And you’ll not leave us for a long time, not till the
journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not till the journey’s end,” she repeated softly.
And how soon would the end come? Who could
tell? Perhaps tonight. One never knew. She shuddered
a little, then turned her attention to the work
of the hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night Mary did not sleep. Sparky had first
call on a time for rest and he surely needed it. He
told her to call him in two hours.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I won’t,” she told herself. “Not if all goes
well. Something tells me I won’t sleep if I have the
chance.” She found herself haunted by a sense of
impending doom. The tall French woman, all in
black, and the stately Moslem lady were constantly
being blended on the pictured walls of her mind.
And after that, with the slow sleepy tread of the
desert, came the two little men and their camels.
They too seemed part of the same picture, but just
how, she could not tell.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>“What foolishness!” she whispered. “Lie down,
you ghosts.” But they would not. They continued
to haunt her.</p>

<p class='c012'>She gave herself over to glimpses of the desert and
the night. There was a glorious moon. The desert
beneath her was full of haunting shadows. For the
most part they were shadows of sandy hills, but at
times they loomed dark and large.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oases,” she told herself. “Wonder if friend or
foe live here—” Sparky had told her that this night
they were to fly over dangerous country. Little
pockets of enemy resistance here had not been
crushed. She was to keep a sharp lookout and if
she sighted a plane, was to call him at once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can outclimb and outfly most enemy
fighters,” he had said. “But we must not let them
get the drop on us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, with eyes and ears alert, she rode on through
the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>All went well. She called Sparky in three hours.
He scolded her for waiting so long.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was the spell of the desert at night,” she told
him. “Seems as if I could fly on and on forever.
And just think! We may never pass this way again!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Life is like that, so why bother?” was the reply.
She went back for her turn at resting, but did not
sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>Was it the spell of the desert night that kept her
awake? Who can say? At least she did not sleep, just
lay there, wrapped in her robe, staring into the darkness,
listening to the roar of the motors and thinking,
thinking.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her father was somewhere in Africa. She knew
that and no more. It would seem strange to pass
over him in the night and not to see him at all. Yet,
that might happen. There was no time for looking
around, no time for anything. They must go on and
on.</p>

<p class='c012'>When two hours had passed, she was back at
Sparky’s side asking for the controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t sleep,” she explained. “Flying over the
desert is fascinating. You don’t care a whoop about
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why not let me have a chance at it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! Why not?” He yielded the controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>As she took over, the words of an old song were
running through her mind:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dance, gypsies; sing, gypsies; dance while you
may.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is in time of war that such simple songs as this
take on a world of meaning.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>She had not been at the controls an hour when the
first faint traces of dawn began to appear.
Then, suddenly, a signal on her board flashed a
grim warning. Instantly her fingers shut off the
fuel and oil from their left motor. The next instant
she turned the carbon-dioxide snow on that motor,
as she called:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Sparky! Quick! Our left motor is on
fire!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky was at her side in an instant.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap07' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>BATTLING AT CLOSE QUARTERS</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“Let me see!” Sparky’s eyes flashed over the instrument
board. “Fuel and oil off, extinguisher on.
Good girl!” He patted her shoulder. “You know
what to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know more than that.” Her lips were in a
straight line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should have stayed with the ship last night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t see that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Someone tampered with our left motor while
you were busy with the other one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not necessarily. Motors have caught fire many
times without tampering. Your motor is set on
springs. That’s to prevent vibration. Because of this
your fuel and oil must come through flexible tubes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know all that,” she broke in. “Sometimes
the connection gets loose. Gas drips on the manifold
and then there is a fire. All the same—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You think our motor was tampered with. Well,
I don’t. Anyway, all we can do is to watch everything,
fly on one, and hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you said this was dangerous country.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>“Very dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dawn is here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The most dangerous of all. If an enemy fighter
spots us, he’s sure to come after us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then—” She was feeling a little dizzy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we’ll have to try to defend ourselves. Mind
if I leave you for a moment?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—I—I’ll carry on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve got a couple of free machine guns. I’ll
have them ready just in case.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Must we fight?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all there is left to do. We can’t climb on one
motor. All we can do is to stay up a mile and go
straight on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Perhaps a fight,” Mary thought as he went
back in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c012'>The gray sands were turning white before the
rising sun. She saw a speck in the distance. Could
it be an enemy plane? She wished Sparky would
come back.</p>

<p class='c012'>Supposing the fire broke out of the motor enclosure
and the ship burned. She shuddered at the
thought. “Of course,” she reassured herself, “we’d
take to our parachutes and escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But escape to what?” a voice seemed to whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>To sifting sands. That was the answer. And then
there was their precious cargo.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was Sparky again. “All set.” His voice was
almost cheerful.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>“Spoiling for a fight?” Mary teased.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wouldn’t mind knocking down one or two of
Hitler’s desert rats,” was the quick reply. “There’s
fighting blood in my family. Grandfather in the
Civil war and Dad all the way with the Canadians
in the other World War. And here I am just flying,
flying, flying, flying. Gets a bit dull at times.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Except,” he hastened to add, “when you have an
attractive co-pilot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was talking, she knew, just to quiet her nerves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s worse to come,” she told herself. And
she was not mistaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fire must be about out by now,” he said a
moment later. “There are a lot of sprays shooting
carbon-dioxide snow at that engine. It’s under 850
pounds of pressure. Turn off the extinguisher and
I’ll work my way back there through the wing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She snapped off the extinguisher. “Can you do
anything about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, sure!” There was a forced cheerfulness in
his voice. “I can get to that engine. I’ll take tools
and a new tube. I’ll fix it. Wait and see!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” She gripped his arm. “Be careful. I
wouldn’t want—well, you know, that desert looks
awfully lonesome.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>“I’ll be careful.” Once again he was gone, leaving
her to the ship’s controls, the desert, and the spreading
dawn. She could see a long way now. There
really was an airplane out there on the horizon. But
then there were planes everywhere these days.</p>

<p class='c012'>This plane acted strangely. It seemed at first to be
coming straight toward her. Then it took a broad
sweep and began to disappear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like some old marauding crow going back to tell
his friends,” she thought. “Hope Sparky won’t be
long. But then, of course, in that cramped place he
can’t work fast. Just have to be patient, that’s all.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The truth is that Sparky had not even started repairing
the engine. There were, he had discovered,
other matters that needed attending to first.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the time Mary was watching the sky. The
plane out there on the edge of the horizon had reappeared.
A mere speck against the blue, it increased
in size. Even at that great distance, she somehow
believed this was a different plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>Presently this plane too cut a broad circle, then
began to fade.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like bees coming out from a hive,” she thought.
“Afraid of us perhaps. Our big, fighting planes
have been knocking them down of late.” If that
were true she hoped they would keep on being
afraid.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>As Sparky crept on hands and knees through the
low wing section of the plane, toward this disabled
engine, he had caught a disturbing sound. “Like the
hiss of a goose,” he thought. He flashed a light before
him, then recoiled as if struck a blow. Little
wonder, for there, not ten feet before him, was a
pair of bulging eyes. Beneath the eyes was a mouth
with a tongue moving up and down.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>“Like a snake,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was not deceived. It was not a snake but, of
all persons, a Jap.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our engine <i>was</i> tampered with!” His head spun,
but his temper rose to a white heat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between him and the Jap was a trap-door leading
to the desert below, providing you had a parachute.
And the Jap had one, strapped to his back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ready to go,” Sparky told himself. “He would
have gone before this, but he was afraid. Now he
will never jump.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As if reading his thoughts, the Jap sprang forward.
He was too late. Sparky was solidly settled on the
door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hissing like a snake, the little man snatched a
knife from his belt. One moment it hung in air, the
next it rattled against the wing’s floor. A heavy
wrench had crushed against the Jap’s arm, all but
breaking it.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div id='fig07'  class='figcenter id010'>

<p><i>Between Him and the Jap Was a Trap-Door</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>Then they came to grips. It was muscle and
brawn against ju-jitsu, and all manner of oriental
tricks. Now an arm, like the tail of a boa-constrictor,
was about Sparky’s neck, choking, choking him to
death. And now Sparky’s steel-like fingers were
gripping the Jap’s arm, twisting it until bones
cracked.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a tooth-and-nail battle. Now the Jap was
clawing at Sparky’s eyes. And now Sparky had those
claws between his teeth.</p>

<p class='c012'>It became a struggle for weapons. Once the Jap
gripped the handle of his knife only to receive a
blow in the face from Sparky’s fist that sent him
reeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>Regaining possession of his wrench, Sparky aimed
a blow at the head of that serpent of the Rising Sun.
Only a sudden upward thrust of a foot saved the
Jap.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll kill you,” the Jap hissed in good English.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on, then. Try it!” Sparky aimed one more
blow at the Jap’s face.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jap dodged. Sparky lost his balance and fell
flat. For a space of seconds he was at the enemy’s
mercy. But to get the knife the Jap must crawl over
Sparky’s body. He tried just that and this was his
undoing for, with a mighty heave, Sparky pinned
him flat and full-length against the hard slats above
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rising to hands and knees, Sparky put all the
power of his splendid muscles into the task of crushing
the last gasp from the now thoroughly beaten
enemy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>When the last gasp came, he slid from beneath
the Jap to let him down with a dull thud. “You
wanted to go down,” Sparky panted. “Now’s your
chance.” His hands were on the trap-door’s fastening.
The Jap lay on that door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he paused to reflect. It would be the end, he
knew, well enough. The Jap was not dead, but helpless.
His parachute had been torn from his back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve got it coming,” Sparky grumbled. “You
planned all this. It would have been our end, not
yours, but now—”</p>

<p class='c012'>His fingers trembled. He undid a catch, then he
fastened it again. He was thinking of the empty
desert and the jackals. “It’s too good for you,” he
grumbled, “but I can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that he bound the Jap, who by this time was
stirring and breathing. Then, pushing him far back
in the wing, he tied him fast. “Tomorrow,” he said
aloud, “they will shoot you at dawn—the firing
squad, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jap’s eyes rolled as a low hiss escaped his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that Sparky went about the business of repairing
the disabled engine.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>And all the time Mary at the controls was growing
more and more uneasy at his prolonged absence.
Little wonder for, out there on the horizon, there
were movements, like that about a beehive when the
bees begin to swarm.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>They were a long way off, but an ever-increasing
threat for all that.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now there was one, now two, now three, and now
five airplanes. Like a small flock of birds they flocked
toward the sky, then all went swooping down again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rehearsing for trouble,” she breathed. “I wish
Sparky would come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What was to be done? Trouble soared in the
distant air. She feared the worst for Sparky yet had
no means of communication with him and could
not for a single instant leave the controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>Despair had begun to grip her heart when there
came a series of bumps behind her and there stood
Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” she exclaimed, “You look terrible!
There’s blood on your face, blood, soot and grease.
What happened?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You were right.” He leaned heavily on the back
of the seat. “There was a man back there, a little
rat of a Jap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew it. I saw him back there at that oasis,”
she exclaimed. “There may be a tall woman in black
in that other wing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you <i>are</i> crazy!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me tell you.” She told of the tall woman in
black and the Arab woman that looked like her.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>“Were those two the same person?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll ask the Jap.” He managed a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you didn’t—” She hesitated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I didn’t kill him,” he answered, “but I
should have. I had a coil of insulated wire in my kit.
I bound him hand and foot with that and left him
back there. I hope he likes it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He won’t get loose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never! Try that engine. I cobbled it up. Take
it easy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She eased the engine into motion once more.
Soon both engines were roaring their best.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! That’s wonderful! Now we’re safe!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not for sure. That motor needs a going over.
We—”</p>

<p class='c012'>He broke off to stare at the northern sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Planes! Headed this way! A whole formation of
them! Say! This is being done according to plan!
The enemy knows of our secret cargo. The Jap was
to cripple us. Those planes were to finish us off.
Well, they won’t. Get out your oxygen mask, girl!
We’re going up to visit the stars. There’s not a
fighter made by those rats that can beat us to the
stratosphere!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She set the ship climbing, then reached for her
oxygen mask. When she had it handy, she set herself
for this new ordeal.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>“But, Sparky!” she cried, “what about the Jap?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, what about him?” he growled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’ll die!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let him die, then!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but you didn’t finish him. You let him live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right. I’ll take him a mask and two oxygen
bottles. It’s a waste of that precious stuff, but there’s
the rule of war. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He vanished and on the instant Mary wished that
she had not spoken. “What is one spy, more or less?”
she asked herself. “Now I’m here to face it alone!”</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap08' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>DESERT BATTLES</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>Oddly enough, as Mary set the big plane climbing
she recalled Sparky’s words, “You are with me to the
journey’s end.” Was this to be the journey’s end?
One thing was sure. During their moments of excitement
over the captured spy, they had allowed the
enemy to come dangerously close. Six fighting planes
were coming roaring toward them at top speed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Breathless with suspense, Mary watched their altitude
increase. Ten thousand feet, eleven, twelve, fifteen
thousand. It was not as fast as this; instead, to
her excited mind the figures appeared to creep upward
like a man with a crutch going upstairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>One plane was ahead of the others. “He’ll get us!
I am sure of that!” she groaned. “Oh! If Sparky
were only here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the on-rushing enemy did a strange thing.
Instead of coming right on, like a catbird after a
hawk, he circled wide, going completely around the
big plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Afraid.” There was contempt in her voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’d better be!” It was Sparky who spoke. He
was standing in the center of the cabin. In his hands
he gripped a heavy machine gun.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>As the enemy circled closer, he opened a window
a crack to send forth a burst of fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>The plane veered off, swinging around before
them, then coming up on the other side.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky had donned his mask. So, too, had Mary.
They were getting into thin air. “If only we can
hold them off,” Mary thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again Sparky’s gun spoke, then again and yet
again. Like a cowardly wolf-pack the fighters were
closing in slowly. There were three of them now.</p>

<p class='c012'>There came the rat-tat-tat of machine gun fire
from the distance. No bullets found their mark.</p>

<p class='c012'>In desperation Mary set her motors going at a
dangerous rate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If that burned motor fails me now—” Her heart
paused, then raced on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good girl!” Sparky encouraged her. “We’re leaving
them behind. They can’t go much farther, not
at this altitude. You, you’re looking white around
the lips. Here! I’ll take the controls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She staggered from her place, leaned for a space
of seconds then, looking down, watched the fighter
planes still battling their way upward. With shaking
hands she reached for the machine gun. “This can’t
be the journey’s end,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>And then something strange happened. The foremost
plane that had been straining to reach them,
faltered in midair, seemed to hang there for a moment,
then, dropping one wing, went into a spiral
dive that increased in speed until it seemed a boy’s
top, spinning in the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dragging her eyes from this fascinating and terrible
sight, she looked for the other planes. They,
too, were going down, but under control. They had
given up the task assigned to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It—it’s all over! Finished!” She sank down in
her place beside Sparky. “That first plane,” she said
after a time, “it went down in a spin. The pilot
didn’t bale out. It just went down, down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve done a lot of duck hunting in my day,”
Sparky replied quietly. “Sometimes I’d shoot at a
flock of ducks in midair. They’d sail right on, but a
mile away, one of them would drop behind, go into
a spin and come plunging down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean your bullets reached that plane?” Mary
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They might have. Then again the fellow may
have climbed too high.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something on his plane froze up?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, or he did. Whichever way it was, there’s
one less of them for our boys over here to take care
of. We won a bloodless battle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, maintaining their altitude, they flew
on for a hundred miles in silence.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>Then, after a good look at the empty sky, Sparky
tilted the plane’s nose downward. Soon they were
dragging off their masks and drinking in the crisp
desert air of the upper reaches.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have to get back and see how my prisoner is getting
on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You—your—oh, yes, that Jap spy.” She took the
controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a strange look on his face when he returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t mean to tell you,” he replied, soberly.
“You asked for it, so here it is. He’s gone to join
his ancestors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Seems his mask didn’t suit him, so he knocked it
off.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In other words he committed hari-kari in a rather
strange way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I gave him a desert burial,” he explained after a
while. “Just opened the trap door to the wing, and
let him down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She nodded. It had been a long, hard journey that
day. She hoped there would be sunshine, laughter
and song at that day’s journey’s end. And, for once,
she was not to be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>A short time later something big loomed up before
them on the horizon. “Is it a mountain?” Mary
asked herself. It seemed a little strange that it should
be there. Then, too, it was so perfect in form, no
bumps on this side or that.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Recognize it?” Sparky asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, could it be—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. That’s exactly what it is,” he laughed. “A
pyramid. And this is Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Egypt!” She was impressed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yup! Better get out your lipstick. We’ll be
landing in about fifteen minutes. I’ve never been
here but the other boys say it’s quite a spot, not so
far from Cairo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You need scrubbing up more than I do, and a bit
of first aid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t bother about me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did, for all that. With a damp cloth she
washed the blood and engine grease from his face,
then applied antiseptic.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that she gave herself a hurried make-up.
And then there they were, circling for one more
landing among the date palms.</p>

<p class='c012'>She found herself a trifle shaky about the knees
when, at last, she stepped down to the good earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>A few steps away a strongly built man was standing
talking to another.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He looks familiar,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then the man turned. “Dad!” she cried. After
three long strides, she was in his arms.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Mary! It’s good to see you!” he boomed. “I knew
you were coming, but I couldn’t let you know where
I was. Why did you volunteer for so dangerous an
assignment?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because I am your daughter,” she replied
proudly. “You wouldn’t want me to stand back,
now, would you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Mary, I wouldn’t. You’ve made it safely this
far. Here’s wishing you luck and safety to the journey’s
end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The journey’s end,” she thought. “If he but
knew how close we came to that end this very day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mary,” her father was saying, “I want you to meet
the finest American flier in Egypt, Captain Burt
Ramsey. Captain Ramsey, this is my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Charmed to meet her, sir,” was the quick response.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am pleased to meet you.” She gave the young
man her best smile. And why not? He stood six-feet-three
and looked every inch the soldier—dark hair,
brown eyes, and that far-away look that fliers, especially
over the desert, acquire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am surprised at that introduction, Colonel
Mason.” The Captain grinned broadly. “From all
you’ve been telling me, this young lady must be the
best flier in Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that’s purely a family matter, paternal
pride,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>“Mary,” he said, “you must be starved, dead for
sleep, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And visibly shaken,” she added. “Yes, all of that
and more. You’d never believe it, but we did away
with two desert rats on this trip.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right,” Sparky, who had just come up,
agreed. “One yellow rat and one that was a doubtful
white.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell us,” Ramsey demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not now,” Mary pleaded. “Perhaps not ever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I just wanted to say,” Sparky broke in, “that we’ll
be here until three tomorrow morning. Our next
hop is a long one and that burned engine needs a
going over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Hours of rest!” Mary nearly collapsed in her
father’s arms. “You’ll never know what that means.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll leave you now,” Burt Ramsey saluted. “Shall
I see you at Waltz Time tonight?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Waltz Time on the radio?” Mary stared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, indeed. Waltz Time on a very good floor
and with an orchestra that lifts its hat to none.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” she breathed, “That will be too much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just the change you need,” her father encouraged.
“You can do a man’s work, but no woman can
be a man all the time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, then, it’s a date.” She put out a hand.
“Father and I will be there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again the Captain saluted, then, turning
about, he marched away.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>After taking her overnight bag from the plane,
Mary climbed into a big car beside her father and
went rolling away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is like old times,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you were staying a week.” He drew a long
breath. “That, of course, is out. That big flight of
four-motored bombers went through here yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our flight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I suppose so. Thirty-eight planes. And they
were burning up the air. Looks as if something big
were in the making over the air of China.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Or Tokio.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s what everyone is hoping, but no one really
knows.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you see our flight leader?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed. They took on gas here. He was very
much concerned about your plane, and—” his voice
dropped, “about your cargo. Made me promise you
fighter protection across the Arabian Desert.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fighter protection. Hmm—we could have used
some today.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll have the very best tomorrow. Captain
Ramsey is going as fighter flight commander. He’ll
have three men with him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! That will be wonderful,” she enthused.
“Even if we don’t run into trouble.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>“Well, here we are. This is where I live.” He
brought the car to a stop before a beautiful little
chateau.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some class!” she exclaimed. “How about my
staying on as your cook?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The cooking is taken care of. I’ll give you a job
as hostess after your journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nope. Not interested. I’m in for the duration.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good girl.” He took her bag. “We’ll find you a
cool, dark room to sleep in and call you in time for
dinner. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing could be sweeter.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>She was awake and dressed for dinner before he
called her and, in spite of the ordeals of the day, felt
quite refreshed and ready for anything.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here’s a party dress I managed to pick up for
you,” her father said, holding out a creation of thin,
dark blue trimmed with some strange Syrian lace.
“Bought it from a Syrian peddler. It’s the real McCoy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Dad! It’s lovely! But for just one night! It
must have cost a fortune!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not so great a fortune,” was his smiling reply.
“Besides, in times like these, when we live so fast, one
night of perfect happiness can be treasured for days
on end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One night of happiness,” she repeated softly.
“That sounds wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>“I’m hoping it may be wonderful. The dance is
to be held at the Officers’ Club, quite a splendid
place. It’s really a British affair, but we’re all in on
it, just as we are in the big fight. Once a week officers
motor from long distances and bring the ladies. The
Colonel’s lady,” he laughed. “I tried to get your
partner Sparky in on the dance,” he added. “He
turned me down, said he needed the time for getting
the plane in shape, but he did promise to have dinner
with us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad, he’s wonderful, Sparky is,” Mary enthused.
“The only trouble with him is,” a wistful note stole
into her voice, “he’s just a machine, like those engines
he watches so carefully.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re lucky to have a partner like that. There’s
only one in a hundred like him. You could fly all
the way around the world with him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Looks as if we might do just that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your destination is China?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What route do you take on your return to America?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I’m afraid we never gave it a thought. Our
journey’s end comes first.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, of course. You’ll return by way of Australia
or Alaska perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Either will be thrilling.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>“And dangerous. Well, now,” his voice changed,
“get on your party dress and we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A maid appeared from nowhere. She had, in truth,
been borrowed from a beauty parlor. When she
looked at herself in the glass after the maid had done
her work, Mary gasped, then experienced a sinking
feeling about her knees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” she thought. “He’ll put on his everyday
coat and come strolling over to the club for dinner.
It’s a shame. I wish I could wear my uniform with a
few spots on it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But then, perhaps she did not know Sparky. Or
was it young Captain Ramsey who had engineered
the transformation? Be that as it may, as she entered
the club, she looked Sparky up and down for a full
ten seconds before she knew him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! You old rogue!” she exclaimed. “Why!
You’re actually handsome! I’d like to—” She advanced
toward him with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Blushing, Sparky backed away. “It says in the
Bible,” he drawled, “that you should let your moderation
appear before all men. You’re not looking
so bad yourself,” he added in a low tone, “but,
pardner, this is no sort of armor for a fightin’ fool.
When do we eat?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Colonel Mason led them to a table in the corner
where the lights were subdued, and there they took
their places, Mary, Sparky, Ramsey, and the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>The food, Mary discovered, was wonderful. “Lend-Lease?”
she whispered to her father.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something like that,” he smiled. “However it
gets here, it’s deserved. All the men you see here,
British, French, or American, are on active duty.
Most of them are fliers. Some have just returned
from Tunisia where they have been on duty for long
weeks. Half their squadron was shot down. Some
are guarding the airways, as Captain Ramsey will be
doing tomorrow. Almost every day some fine fellow
fails to return—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they seem so happy and cheerful.” Her eyes
swept the large room filled with laughing, chattering
men and their ladies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly. What do you ask?” was the quick reply.
“You just must believe in your luck and keep
your sense of humor. You, who have come a long
way, should know that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—” she agreed. “Yes, of course, I know it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then young Captain Ramsey claimed her attention.
For the next half hour he held it. While
the Colonel and Sparky were busy comparing notes
on the performance of various types of airplanes, she
and Ramsey talked and laughed as they compared
notes on the lives they had lived before the war descended
upon them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will never be the same,” she sighed at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course it won’t,” he agreed. “But do you
really wish it?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>“I—I don’t know,” she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you don’t. None of us does. We’ve
been whirled completely out of that world. When
we get back, if we do—” his voice fell, “then’s the
only time we’ll really know what we want. That’s
why I say, ‘forget the post-war problems. Let’s get
on with the war.’ We—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look!” She gripped his arm. “There’s an Arab.
The head-waiter is bringing him this way. Oh, I’m
scared.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Arabs are harmless enough.” He gave her a
questioning look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not all who pass as Arabs are harmless,” she insisted.
There was no time for explaining. The Arab,
with the head-waiter at his elbow, had arrived at
their table.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap09' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IX</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>A ROLL OF PAPYRUS</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“I tried to tell him, sir, that it was not right that
he should come in,” the polite waiter apologized to
the Colonel, Mary’s father. “I said it is not convenient,
it is not allowed, but he would come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all right, Pierre,” the Colonel spoke quietly.
“What is it you wish?” He turned to the Arab.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sir, if you knew.” The Arab spoke English
without a flaw. “You are interested in Egypt, all her
past,—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes, I know, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is this.” The man drew something from beneath
his robe. Both Sparky and Ramsey half rose in
their places, then settled back for, the Arab’s fingers,
long and thin, held what appeared to be a roll of
paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking the roll, the Colonel removed the outer
layer of green paper, of a peculiar tint, then examined
the dull, gray roll beneath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it papyrus?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Colonel,” came in a whisper. “From an
ancient tomb. It is, I believe, three thousand years
old.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>The Colonel made no reply. Instead he took
from his pocket a small, powerful magnifying glass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary, who was watching the Arab, saw a sudden
look of fear pass over his face. It was little more
than a flitting shadow, yet she was to recall it in the
days to come.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said the Colonel after a minute examination
of the roll, “it is papyrus. Beyond a doubt it is
quite old. And I suppose you want to sell it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no! No! No!” The man’s face was twisted
into a look of terror. “It is not for me to sell. I must
send it to Dr. Spinka. He is a great Egyptologist.
His home is in America.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I am not returning to America. Perhaps I
shall never return.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, yes, but the young lady—” The Arab leaned
forward, hiding the roll under his long robe. “She
is but a visitor. Is it not so? She will return very
soon. Is this not true?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps.” The Colonel spoke slowly. “What do
you say, Mary? Will you accept the responsibility?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No!” was the quick response. “How could I?
Even my own life is not safe. Only today—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! Yes, it is true,” the Arab broke in, “today,
yes, but the miserable wretch who threatened your
life is dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What? How did you find this out?” Sparky demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>“Not so loud, my friend,” the Arab spoke in a
hoarse whisper, at the same time completely covering
the roll. “There are those who would kill me
for having this roll.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They would kill me as quickly,” Mary declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, but they shall not know. It shall be at your
Chateau one minute before you go. You fly to
Persia. I do not ask, I know. I shall not speak. I am
always to be trusted. In Persia they do not care for
papyrus. There you are safe. Wherever you go, you
are safe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary looked to her father for the answer to this
strange problem. What he said puzzled her more
than a little.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no reason why you should not take this
with you. At my house and the airport you will
have ample protection.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You, of course, must take the risk of its being
destroyed by the fortunes of war.” He spoke to the
Arab.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It shall be in the hands of God and a lady,” was
the reply. “If God wills its destruction, I shall bare
my head. As for the lady, I trust her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is then so arranged.” The Colonel re-wrapped
the roll. “The roll must be in my hands at midnight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, sir, the plane does not—”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Colonel held up a hand. “None but God is
permitted to know the hour of departure. Midnight—how
do you say?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>“It is the will of God.” The Arab was gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two hours that followed will linger long in
Mary’s memory. “I never dreamed of anything like
this when I volunteered for this trip,” she said to
Captain Ramsey, as they swung away for the dance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You expected only blood, sweat, and tears,” he
replied soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something like that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s mostly what war is like. But there must
be change and contrast, laughter, music and the
lighter touch or we break and then we’re no good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Music, laughter, and the lighter touch, that was
what they had during the next swiftly passing hours.
The dances were all waltzes. The strange, fantastic
orchestra—Mary could not name half the instruments—played
very well. There was a wild ecstasy
running through it all. The shrill pipe of reed instruments,
the tom-tom-tom of strange drums at
times set her blood tingling. Then, too, there were
moments of quiet, swinging rhythm that set her
dreaming.</p>

<p class='c012'>The people too were interesting, intriguing. Dark-eyed,
Egyptian women; slender, young French officers;
smiling, little French ladies with faces like
dolls; imperial dames from the British Isles—all
these swung past her and on out of sight.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>She danced with Ramsey, with her father, and
with nice British and American boys to whom she
was introduced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” she said to Ramsey, “is the sort of life I
used to love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For tonight—yes—tonight it is divine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not for tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not tomorrow. Even now I find my hands reaching
for the controls, my fingers itching for the feel
of the switches, and my ears listening for the roar of
the motors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It gets in your blood. I know. What’s it going
to be after it’s all over?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll know when it is all over, if we’re still
around to know. Let’s have tonight for tonight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And tomorrow for tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The music ceased. That dance was over. It was
announced that the orchestra would play two selections
that were not dances.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We sit these out. Come on!” He led her by the
hand. “There’s a spot before the fountain where
we can sit and watch the pyramid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does it need watching?” she asked with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems not.” His tone was sober as he helped
her to a seat beneath the stars. “I like to watch it all
the same. Sometime I expect it to speak to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speak to you?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>“Yes, why not? Surely it’s stood there in silence
long enough. Look,” he leaned close to her, “did
you ever think what that great pile of stone over
there stands for?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course not. You haven’t watched it night
after night as I have. It stands for power. That’s
what. The power one man wielded over thousands
and thousands of others. Think of the weary years
toiled cutting those stones with primitive tools and
getting them up, up, up toward the sky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because some man wanted to be remembered
after he was dead. They did remember, but only
to curse him. We have our monuments today, skyscrapers,
museums, places for fishes to live in,
homes for mummies and stuffed elephants. They
have been built by men who wanted to be remembered.
But the people who pay for them are the little
people who have made machines, sold goods, and
all that for a little pay, and who were left to finish
their lives as best they could when they were too old
to work any more. That is what the pyramid will
say to me some moonlit night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what shall you do about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Probably nothing, just as other generations have
done. But see here!” he sprang to his feet. “This
was to be a night!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>“Of music, laughter and the lighter touch.” She
supplied the words. “Well, there’s the music. Isn’t
it lovely?”</p>

<p class='c012'>When it was over and they were sauntering back
toward the dance floor he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m to be up there with you over the Arabian
Desert tomorrow. Rommel’s desert rats have a hidden
base somewhere out there. We lose a plane now
and then, never get a trace of it. It seems your father
doesn’t want you to get lost.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you’re right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There will be three other escorting planes in the
squad. They will all be double seaters. I’ll be in a
single-seater, a regular blue devil of a fighting
plane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I’ll be able to recognize you. How grand!” she
enthused. “You shall be my knight in shining
armor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure, it’s like going back to ancient days, when
fair ladies and rich treasure in coaches were guarded
on their way by armored knights on horseback.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Swift steeds you ride now,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Real enough for all that. The lady is real, too,
and the treasure, never forget that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you any notion what the treasure is?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not the slightest. All we know, Sparky and I, is
that it is of the greatest importance to China and
that it must go through.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>“Here we are,” he said, helping her up the steps.
“One more dance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One more and that’s all,” she agreed. “I must
have my beauty nap, for tomorrow I am a working
woman again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A short time later they said good-night to the
Colonel who assured them he was leaving at once.
Then he drove her home in his car.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s been the most delightful evening of my life,”
she declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the contrast,” was his reply. “Today you
were in great danger.” She had told him of her adventure
with the spy. “Tonight you have been safe
with the right kind of people and quite happy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who knows? I shall be with you in the Arabian
skies. That much is decided. The rest is chance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He went with her to the door of the chateau.
Then, gripping her hand he whispered: “Just something
to remember.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not refuse. A moment later, a little
flushed and quite happy, she was in her own room
preparing for a few winks of sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was just putting on the night robe that had
been left for her when her father entered the
chateau.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have a good time?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>“Best ever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s splendid! I wish you were to be here a
week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t,” was the quick reply. “I love duty, and,
I’m ashamed to say it, danger. But, Dad, I don’t see
this papyrus business. Why should I take that roll
to America?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It might be dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s scarcely a chance. In the first place, I
know that Arab. He seems an honorable old man.
In the second, I shall place your overnight bag in
your plane the moment before you start—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the roll will be in that bag?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly. Once you are in the air, the roll cannot
possibly get you into trouble. When you arrive at
your destination there is not a chance in a thousand
that anyone there will know about that papyrus—or
any papyrus, for that matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you see—” he went on, “you will be aiding
this aged Arab and, at the same time, adding a little
to our American collection of Egyptian lore. Some
rare discoveries have been made by those who delve
into the mysteries of the messages recorded thousands
of years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps this tells of some war fought and won
on these very grounds,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>“Here is a card,” he said, handing her a square of
cardboard. “On it I have written the address of my
old professor of Egyptology. I suggest that you show
the roll to him before you deliver it to this Doctor
Spinka—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he hesitated, “in these times we must be
very careful. There is an off chance that an enemy
spy is working through this Arab to turn a sharp
trick on us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if that is true, your professor will discover
it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He and his colleagues.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay—good-night, Dad. You’ll call me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll be at the airport on time, with a good cup
of coffee and toasted English muffins under your
belt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The off chance is sometimes the real chance, also
the wisest of men sometimes make mistakes. It is
also true that the game is neither won nor lost until
the last card is played. The roll of papyrus went
aboard Mary’s plane as planned and was promptly
forgotten.</p>

  <h2 id='chap10' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER X</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>TWO CAN HIDE IN A CLOUD</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>When, at three A.M., Mary walked up to her
plane, she found Ramsey waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I just wanted to tell you,” he said, “that you need
not be frightened if your fighter escort seems at times
to disappear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Disappear from the sky? How could you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Even over the desert at times there are fleecy,
white clouds, like a filmy party dress.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you hide behind them—not the dresses, but
the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then you come dashing out at the Messerschmitts?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right again. That may seem like using your
plane as a decoy. Perhaps it is, in a way. But we’re
guarding the airways and we must get those flying
rats. Two of our finest boys, the grandest in the
world, vanished over that desert, just last week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be seeing you.” She climbed up to take her
place in the plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>She found Sparky looking rather bleary-eyed. “Big
job getting that burned engine into shape,” was his
curt explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>“I’m all rested up,” she said. “Just as soon as
we’re well in the sky, I’ll take the ship. You’re due
for two hour’s rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Guess that’s safe enough.” He handed her the
“Form One” card. “Those brigands of the air don’t
operate close to this airport.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She studied the card. He turned on fuel and ignition,
then tested his fuel tanks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay,” he murmured. At that he primed the
motors, set the energizer whirling, nodded to the
mechanic, flipped on the fuel booster, nodded once
more to the mechanic, then they were away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Five minutes later Sparky slipped from his place
and Mary had the big ship all to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a marvelous day. They were flying at eight
thousand feet. The indistinct desert trails seemed
mere lines. Camel trains were moving insects.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they advanced, the occasional villages began to
disappear. At times she imagined that she saw elephants
and droves of zebras close to the same water
hole.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their fighter escort caught up with them when
they were an hour from port.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Port.” That was the name Mary found herself
giving to the place she had left. Why not? One left
a port for a sea lane. Sea lanes were carefully guarded
these days. Their fighter escorts were like destroyers.
They guarded her air lane. And her plane’s load
might, for all she knew, be more precious than a big
ocean freighter’s cargo.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>“Well,” she thought, “we’re fully halfway between
America and China and they haven’t got us yet.
We—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her thoughts broke off short. Had she spotted a
plane flying low on the horizon?</p>

<p class='c012'>As if to confirm her suspicion, her escort flew in
close. She recognized the long, slim, sleek fighter
flown by Ramsey. He dropped his right wing in
salute.</p>

<p class='c012'>The last plane in Ramsey’s fighter formation gave
her a real shock. The pilot dropped the plane’s nose,
then pulled it up short as if he were riding a bucking
bronco.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” she told herself, “is one of Dad’s tricks.
But he can’t be in that two-seater. He’s taught the
trick to one of his men, I suppose. I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c012'>For a full hour after that she zoomed straight on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be in Persia in a few hours, dining in one
of those rare Persian gardens.” For her Persia was
Persia, the Persia of the golden moon. People could
call it Iran if they chose. She was all for the beauty
and romance that had been Persia.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were fleecy, white clouds in the sky just as
Ramsey had said. The members of their flying escort
seemed to be playing a game of hide-and-go-seek
among those clouds. Then, just as a thicker cloud
shut her off from the light of the sun, they all vanished.</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>At that moment, as everything took on a darker
hue, she seemed, to be in a lonely little world all
her own. She wanted to call Sparky but could not
get the consent of her mind to do so. “Poor Sparky,”
she thought, “he works so hard. And when he’s
through the old ship moves on like a placid river.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Another quarter hour passed and then suddenly
she called in a startled voice:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Sparky!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” He was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not answer, only pointed forward and
down, then set her plane climbing toward a cloud,
at the same time driving the engines into a tremendous
roar. Four powerful enemy fighters were all but
upon them and, as if bent upon suicide and destruction,
racing straight on. If these pilots had rejoiced
because of their rare find, their exultation was short
lived, for, darting from a cloud, a flying fury sprang
straight at their leader.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ramsey!” Mary exclaimed. “It’s Ramsey! He’ll
be killed!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Give me the controls,” Sparky’s voice was quiet.
After slowing the motors, he continued to climb.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s our only chance,” he grumbled. “Not much
of a chance at that. Those Huns are too close. If it
wasn’t for those fighters of ours we’d be lost.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>“Lost before you could say it,” Mary agreed. “But
Ramsey! Ramsey!” she screamed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The leader of the Messerschmitts had let loose a
burst of fire at Ramsey’s plane but, tilting his ship’s
nose, he had gone shooting beneath the enemy to
execute a turn that was like a pinwheel and then to
send three short, sharp bursts at the flying Hun.</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed to Mary as she looked that the Messerschmitt
had been sawed squarely in two. It doubled
up, began to smoke, then went spinning down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll take the controls,” she said. “You man the
machine gun. They may come straight at us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hardly had Sparky gripped the machine gun when
one of the remaining flying bandits came zooming in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s got a cannon,” Mary thought. “He’ll get our
right engine and then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But he didn’t. Seeming to have hopped off from
the back of her plane, a two-seated fighter leaped
straight at the on-coming enemy.</p>

<p class='c012'>As if fearing a collision in mid-air, the enemy pilot
banked sharply to the left. This left his broadside
exposed. At the same instant, both the gunner of
the two-seater and Sparky let go a smoking fury of
fire. For a moment the enemy appeared to stand still
in mid-air. Then its nose turned swiftly downward
as it went into a spin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two of them!” Mary exulted. “We’ll have them
all in a minute more.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>But when it comes to enemy fighting planes it
would seem that four minus two equals five for, as
she looked again, she saw five planes zooming straight
at them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sun came out from behind the cloud. At that
all the planes shone in that bright light. Mary’s big
plane with its precious load still climbed, but to her
excited mind it seemed so slow. “Like a lumbering
stage coach,” flashed through her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fighters, too, climbed. It was one of those
times when a minute seems an hour, when the work
of a lifetime is rewarded for good or evil in a trice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before the girl’s astonished eyes, a rare spectacle
of the air formed itself, then put on its deadly show.
Six planes, three of the enemy and three of her
fighter escort, formed in a circle, head-to-tail. Each
striving for the advantage, went circling round and
round.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Ramsey who broke this up. Darting out
from a cloud he sent a burst of fire into the tail-end
enemy plane, then with a wide swing met the foremost
enemy head-on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary caught her breath. It seemed to her that
they must crash. A moment more and they were hidden
by smoke. One had been hit. Which one? She
could not tell.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>Free for the moment, the remaining enemy of the
three headed straight for the big cargo ship. Then
it was that the two-seater pilot, who had given her
the bronco-nose salute earlier in the day, got in
some deadly work, for, with surprising speed, he got
on this last plane’s tail and brought him down in
flames.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good work!” she screamed. “But, Ramsey?
What of Ramsey?” She was soon enough to know.</p>

<p class='c012'>After allowing her eyes to sweep the sky making
sure that the two other enemy planes were not an
immediate menace, she turned once more for a look
at the spot where Ramsey and his opponent had
been. They were not there, but high in the sky and
still climbing, Ramsey was in hot pursuit of his
antagonist.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Both planes are smoking,” she said to Sparky
who had come to stand at her side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But neither badly,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There! Oh! There!” she exclaimed. “The Spitfire
has gone into a nose dive!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t expect too much. He’s not badly hurt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Scarcely had Sparky spoken when the enemy
plane, coming out of his dive, spun around in a narrow
circle to get on Ramsey’s tail and let forth a
burst of fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! He’s got him! Poor Ramsey’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Give me the controls.” Sparky took over while,
with lips parted, eyes staring, Mary watched for the
end.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>The end was not yet. Ramsey’s slender fighter
staggered, spun half about, tilted over, did two complete
flip-flops, then by some miracle, or by the sheer
will-power of her master, righted herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>By some good chance, Ramsey found himself facing
his on-coming opponent. He must have pressed
the firing button and given her the works for the
enemy plane appeared to fall to pieces in mid-air—not,
however, until its pilot had sent one more burst
of fire into Ramsey’s smoking plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s on fire! He’s going down!” Mary shouted.
At that moment she was seeing war in all its stark
naked horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There! Your friend Ramsey’s out of the plane,”
Sparky said quietly as ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good!” The girl settled back. “His parachute is
open. He’s coming down. But, Sparky! we’ll be
right beneath him!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky banked sharply to the right. Mary leaped
for the door. Bracing herself against the current of
air, she threw the door open, to stand there waiting,
looking up, hoping.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yes, there he was drifting down. He was closer,
closer, much closer. He saw her. She could see him
smile. She waved. He waved back. She shouted:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be seeing you!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>He could not hear, but understood. With his
hand he threw her a kiss. Then he was gone. When
Mary brushed her hands across her eyes, they were
wet with tears.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, seated beside Sparky, she sat in silence
while miles of desert and mountains, narrow, green
valleys, and more mountains passed beneath them
until, with surprising suddenness, a small city with
many trees, domes and strange rooftops appeared
beneath them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it,” Sparky said quietly. “We come down
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A little beyond the city that nestled among the
hills, they dropped into a narrow valley and down
upon a landing field.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Mary stepped from the plane, she once again
found herself staring at a familiar, broad back and,
as the man turned, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad! It’s you!”</p>

  <h2 id='chap11' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>THE TUMBLING DONKEY</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“Ramsey,” Mary caught her breath. “Did he—he—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did he land safely?” Her father’s eyes shone. “Of
course he did. I followed him down in my two-seater.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You!” she exclaimed. “Were you in that fight?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely. Didn’t you recognize my bronco-buster
salute?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t think it was I? I don’t wonder at that.
I would have told you I was to be in it, but I was
afraid it would make you nervous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nervous?” she shuddered. “After today, I shall
never be nervous again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a grand fight,” he enthused. “You and
Sparky had a real part in it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And we’re still here safe and sound. So’s our
cargo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he frowned, “but that was a narrow escape.
Here’s hoping you meet with nothing like that on
the remaining laps of your important mission.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>“Without Ramsey and you, it would have been
fatal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ramsay is a brave and skillful fighter. I’ve known
no better. I stayed around long enough to see that
he was picked up by one of the other planes. Then
my gunner and I flew on toward Persia. We made
one stop for fuel but beat you here as it is. Our
plane is really fast.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he sighed, “it’s been quite a day. We
cleaned up that nest of hornets. Two of them got
away, but we’ve spotted their landing field and can
finish them off later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve got a little business here. You’ll not be leaving
before morning?” he said, turning to Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Daylight is best for our next long flight,” said
Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it pays to be at your best on such a journey,”
Colonel Mason agreed. “Persia is worth a good, long
look.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be looking after the plane,” said Sparky,
hurrying away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, my overnight bag!” Mary called, hurrying
after him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will meet you at the desk in the small landing
field depot,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Set your bag in this corner,” her father told her
when he joined her in the depot later. “Persian
coffee is not bad, and their lemon ice is really good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hot coffee and lemon ice,” she laughed as she
dropped into a low, rattan chair. “What a combination!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>“Try it. You’ll find it hits the spot,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have a friend in the city,” he told her. “A
wealthy Persian merchant. He takes great pride in
his garden. It is really very wonderful. I want you
to see it. But first we’ll take a car up town and reserve
rooms for the night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look!” Mary exclaimed, springing up. “That
man is carrying off my bag! Quick! Stop him! That
roll of papyrus!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, no,” her father stopped her. “There’s your
bag, right where you left it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure—there it is,” she stared in surprise. “But
think of a man having an overnight bag just like
mine, and in such a strange place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“American-made goods go everywhere. My merchant
friend sells many articles from America. Most
of the cotton used in his prints comes from
America.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For all that Mary breathed a sigh of relief as she
picked up her bag.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s that roll of papyrus,” she sighed. “I wouldn’t
mind about the other things. I suppose they could
all be replaced from the shops right up here in the
city.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every item,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that they did not know the half of it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>A few moments later they hailed a cab and rode
up to the strange little city half hidden among the
barren hills.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll not see anything like it for a long time,”
he assured her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having secured a suite of three rooms in a small
hotel, they departed, after depositing their bags, for
a look at the city.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll hire a couple of donkeys,” her father said,
“and ride up to the bazaar. That’s the most colorful
spot of all, and that too is where we will find my
friend of the glorious garden.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary felt very much as if she were riding astride
a child’s scooter as their shaggy donkeys crept down
the hot, dusty street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It all takes you back into the past,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, a thousand years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it’s charming for all that, a glorious place to
rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After riding down narrow, winding streets they
came to the gates of the bazaar which, with its
vaulted roof, offered cooling shade from the heat of
the day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We ride in,” her father explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How odd!” she said, patted her donkey, and in
they went. At once they found themselves in a jam
of donkeys, camels, and perspiring men. “Avarda!
Avarda!” sounded on every side.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>“What do they mean—Avarda?” Mary asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That means, ‘Make room!’,” her father explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right,” she laughed. “Avarda! Avarda!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They came at last to the shops where men sat
cross-legged in the midst of their wares. Here were
piles of cups, saucers, pitchers and plates, there were
all manner of brooms, here piles of cheap, cotton
prints and over in this corner long, flowing gowns.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My friend has a large shop back a little from the
others,” the Colonel explained, “This seems a quiet
spot. Hold my donkey. I’ll be back.” He hurried
up a flight of narrow stairs. To Mary the passing
throng, Arabs, Syrians, black slaves, Jews with packs
on their backs, and portly strangers of seeming importance,
were a fascinating study in character and
life.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a man of portly importance who at last
caught her attention. She had seen him before, but
where? One swift glimpse at the picture walls of
her memory and she knew. He was the man who
had been carrying a bag exactly like her own.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then their eyes met. For ten seconds his startled
eyes were upon her. Then, shouting, “Avarda!
Avarda!” he forced his stout donkey through the
throng, all but running several people down, at last
disappearing from sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How strange,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>All too soon she was to learn that his actions had
more meaning than they appeared to have.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is all arranged.” Her father was again at her
side. “We are to be at the garden gate in just two
hours. You’ll find it fascinating, the experience of a
lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In these days,” she replied slowly, “each experience
is one of a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I just saw the man who has an overnight bag
like mine,” she added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you? What of that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t really know. He ducked, that’s all, rode
a donkey right through the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s strange.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It sure was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When, some twenty minutes later, in search of a
clean handkerchief, Mary opened her bag, she let
out a gasp:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why! This is not my bag!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her father stared. “It must be!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s not. These garments are not mine. Nothing
is mine. And,” she ran her hand through the carefully
packed bag, “the roll of papyrus is not here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That man must somehow have gotten his bag
mixed with yours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But this is a lady’s bag.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must belong to his wife.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>“But he’s fat, a Dutchman, or German I think.
Who ever heard of a slender German housefrau?
And these clothes are my size.” She held up a shimmering
dream robe. “It’s the strangest thing I ever
heard of,” she said when, after five minutes of examining
the contents of the bag, she held up a beautiful
party dress. “You’d think that my bag had been
burned up, contents and all, and that someone, who
knew the contents very well, had gone to the trouble
of replacing it piece by piece. Every article here is
brand new. Only the papyrus roll is missing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is strange,” her father agreed, “but the ways of
enemy spies are past finding out, or, perhaps, he was
only an Oriental robber.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A thief of Bagdad?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something like that. The roll of papyrus may be
quite valuable, worth many thousands. That depends
upon the Egyptian dynasty from which it
came. Museums pay almost any price for certain
rare writings from those ancient times.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did I accept it?” Mary moaned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did I encourage you to accept it,” he
amended. “Perhaps time will bring the answer.
Then again there may be no real answer. Come, let’s
get ready for the Persian garden party. We have
quite a way to go, and donkeys are slow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t happen to have any secret papers in
your traveling bag, did you?” he asked as they rode
toward his friend’s garden home.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>“None whatever, not even a letter. Sparky keeps
all our papers in a secret compartment of the plane.
That’s where the papyrus should have been, but who
would suppose—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That anyone in Persia would be interested in
that roll?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, or know anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The enemy’s network of spies is vast and endless.
Without doubt they have radio connections with
every large city.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You keep hinting that the papyrus carries a secret
message or something. You surely don’t think
a message written so long ago means anything to this
generation?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are those who do. I can find you men
who will tell you how this war is to end. They found
it all written out in the Koran, or the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not clearing things up much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s forget the whole business,” he suggested.
“We accepted no responsibility, only agreed to try
to get the roll to America. Well, at present, it appears
that we have failed. The sun is lower now.
My friend’s garden will be delightful. Let us sing
while we may.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The garden was all that he had promised, and
more. Having arrived at a massive, iron-bound gate
in a wall, they tethered their donkeys, then knocked.
The gate swung open and they stepped inside.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>“Look up,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How gorgeous!” Mary exclaimed as her eyes
feasted themselves on the scene that lay above them.
Up a steep slope ran two stone walks. Between these
walks a small stream of crystal-clear water gurgled
and danced over bright colored tiles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between the walks and water were narrow flower
beds all aglow with blossoms.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here and there the stream spread out into a pool
or rose into a spouting fountain. About the pools
were more flowers, while on the surface water lilies—lily
pads with yellow flowers—lay.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they walked slowly up the narrow walk, the
valley widened a little. Low trees began to appear
on either side. Beyond this they saw a small house
that was all doors and windows.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s out of a story book,” Mary whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Arabian Nights,” her father agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>They entered the house. At its center a small
fountain played. About its walls were low benches
piled high with cushions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” Mary breathed, settling herself among the
cushions. “Why must life go on and on when it
could end itself in a blaze of glory right here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her father laughed but made no reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a long time they remained silent, gazing at the
scene before them, bright flowers, gently swaying
trees, dashing water, and beyond that, in sharp contrast,
dull, brown, barren hills and grassless valleys.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>“It’s like life,” Mary whispered. “Beautiful and
gay, then somber and sad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>However, it seemed that for the time their lives
were to be filled with beauty, gayety and charm, for
here was their jovial host and with him two black
slaves bearing trays of fruit, cakes, and tea.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the tea and cakes were gone, they sat for
a time in silence, just resting and admiring the
scene that lay beneath their feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is one time when I wish I could paint pictures,”
Mary murmured at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The charm of our little world here is its contrast,”
said the host, pleased by her words. “Without
the brown hills beyond, our gardens would not seem
half as beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again there was silence for a time. And then
came the slaves bringing rice cooked with meat, a
roast of mutton, bread, cheese, fruit and light, red
wine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! a feast!” the Colonel exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have very little here in the hills,” his host
apologized in true Eastern fashion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is wonderful,” said Mary, “and more wonderful
still to have time for enjoying it. Tomorrow, we
shall be rushing through the air once more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When there is a feast one forgets tomorrow,” said
their host.</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>But Mary could not forget. She thought of many
things, the bag, the boy beachcomber she had left
behind in South America, of the fine boys of the
desert and Ramsey who had guarded her so well, and
of the vanishing papyrus. “What of tomorrow?” she
asked herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>With one ear she was catching threads of a conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, he is short and rather fat,” her father was
saying, “rather pompous, a Dutchman or perhaps a
German.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I think I know him,” was their host’s reply.
“He says he is from Holland. He trades in cheap
pottery and sometimes in toys. I think he is German.
We shall catch up with that man, you and I.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She knew they were speaking of the man who had
taken her bag.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were to “catch up with that man” sooner
than she thought, not her father and their host, but
her father and herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Night was falling as they rode back into the village.
They were passing along a street lined on one
side by low homes and on the other by a hill that
sloped away from them, when they caught up with
a vaguely familiar figure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It can’t be that I know him,” the girl thought.
“He is wearing a long, Persian robe. I am acquainted
with no Persians.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>The man turned to look back. Starting, she whispered:
“There’s that man!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were abreast of him when, suddenly, the
wind blew back his robe, giving them a moment’s
glimpse at a flash of peculiar green.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then it was that the Colonel did a strange thing.
Apparently he kicked his donkey in the back of the
forelegs, for, suddenly, he stumbled and fell to his
knees. At the same time the Colonel went over sideways
with a lunge that carried both him and the
astonished pedestrian in a Persian robe, over the
edge of the road and half way down the steep decline.</p>

<p class='c012'>Expecting a struggle and perhaps shots, Mary
sprang from her donkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were no shots. Instead, in the half darkness
she saw one shadowy figure go gliding down the hill
while the other came struggling back up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad! Did you get it?” she whispered, greatly
excited.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I hadn’t I would be going down, not up.” He
was panting a little.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Couldn’t you hold him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Didn’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t want to!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t know the laws of the Medes and Persians.”
Her father laughed low. “They alter not
and if we had him put in jail, you’d be here until
Christmas as a witness.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>“Wise old dad.” She patted him on the back.
“But see! Our donkeys are gone!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let them go. I have paid for their use. They’ll
find their own way home to their supper. We’ll catch
a cab and get out to the airport at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?” The word was on the tip of her tongue
but she did not say it.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap12' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>SEALED ORDERS</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>Once they were safely stowed away in a cab he
pulled the green-wrapped package from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Papyrus,” he said softly, “like our paper of today,
has caused a lot of trouble in the world. Today
a printing press rattles and bangs for an hour or two
and not many weeks later two groups of men, one a
band of thugs, the other a squad of officers, shoot it
out for possession of that printing press’s work. And
all because it says on each slip of paper, ‘Payable to
the bearer on demand.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why would that man risk his life to get that
roll of ancient papyrus?” Mary asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said her father, “appears to be something
I must find out!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You or I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are practically out of it. We’re taking the
roll to Sparky. He’ll hide it in his secret compartment
for the night. When I fly back to Egypt tomorrow
the roll will go with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?” Mary’s eyes opened wide.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hasn’t it caused you enough trouble?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not if it’s really important.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>“It seems to be all of that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why should I give it up now?” She was
very much in earnest. “You know, in a very old
book I sometimes read, it says something about putting
your hand to the plow, then turning back. I
don’t like turning back, or giving up. It’s part of
my religion not to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So that’s the way you feel about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but—” she hesitated, “one thing is more important
than the papyrus.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your ship’s cargo? I agree with you. It is all-important.
Helping to get it through to China is
the most important task you’ve ever undertaken, or
perhaps ever will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will taking the papyrus make that harder?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I doubt that. Sparky will always be with the
ship. It is true that somehow the enemy agents here
have learned of the papyrus, and wanting it for,
God knows what reason, have made a play for it.
But will they carry this on even in India and China?
I doubt that. When you hop off from here, you will
be headed for quite another world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Another world,” she repeated the words softly.
“That sounds strange and, and rather frightening.
But, unless you seriously object, the papyrus goes
with Sparky and me to that other world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then that’s settled,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now, here they were at the airport.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>“Well! For once!” Mary exclaimed as they came
up to the plane. “Here’s Sparky. And he’s not working
on the engines. What’s the matter, Sparky? Are
you sick?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—” he drawled. “Couldn’t think of a thing
that needed doing, so I’ve just been reading a book
about Persia. Quite a place I’d say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll watch the ship while you look the city
over,” the Colonel volunteered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, thanks all the same.” Sparky’s sun-bronzed
face crinkled into a smile. “I’m turning in—sleep
on the job, you know—in a few minutes.
We’ll take off at dawn. You’ll be here, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yep. Johnny-on-the-spot. And, Sparky, since
you’re guarding the ship, here’s one more little thing
you can keep an eye on. Put it in our hiding-place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sure! What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just a bunch of old papers.” It was the Colonel
who replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very old,” Mary grinned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes, I remember, that old Arab’s stuff,”
Sparky yawned. “Lot of trouble for very little, I’d
say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mary agreed. “A whole lot of trouble.”
She laughed, and Sparky wondered why.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Mary and her father re-entered their rooms
at the hotel a half-hour later, things seemed a little
strange.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>“I left that bag on that low bench,” Mary recalled.
“Now it’s standing beside the bench. What’s more,
it doesn’t look quite the same.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Picking it up, she turned it on its side, placed it on
the bench, then threw back the snaps. Up came the
lid.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad!” she exclaimed, “it’s my bag! The things
are all there, even a candy bar I bought at the U.S.O.
in Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very kind of our Nazi friends to return it. Probably
came in through the window.” He wandered
about testing the catches. “That’s right,” he called
at last. “The window in my sleeping room is unlocked.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lock it, please,” said Mary. “I—I’m feeling a little
strange.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll be all right when the windows are locked
and the shades down.” And she was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dad,” she said, after a few moments of quiet
thought. “Perhaps that other bag belonged to the
woman in black.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The woman in black?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Don’t you remember? The one who seemed
to be working with the Jap spy who posed as an
Arab.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She was in West Africa.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, of course, and then I’ll never be sure that
the French woman at the port and the Arab woman
at the secret oasis were the same person.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>“You’ll probably never know that,” was his reply.
“However, it would be my guess that they were two
different people and, if there is really a woman mixed
up in this affair of the papyrus, that she is still another.
In this country and in Africa where spies are
common, it is not difficult to maintain a regular
fraternity of lady spies. To pass on a message from
spy to spy is easy but for one spy to travel by plane
from place to place in territory controlled by our
friends is practically impossible. At any rate your
bag is back and so is the papyrus and that, for the
moment, is all that matters. And I’m surely going to
see you safely off in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In spite of the mysterious events of the day, and
her strange surroundings, Mary slept well that night.
Why not? Was not her father close at hand? Had he
not been with her during the greater part of her life?
And had she not always felt secure when he was near?</p>

<p class='c012'>She awoke an hour before dawn to wish with all
her soul that he was going with them all the way to
the very end. But this, she knew, was impossible. He
had stretched a point coming this far. His work was
in Egypt, keeping the airways clear. He must turn
back.</p>

<p class='c012'>She bounded out of bed and, a half hour later,
sprang from their car to greet the cold, gray dawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sunshine, fountains, flowers, and now this. All a
part of life,” she thought with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>After switching on the plane’s lights she crowded
her way back through the cabin. She examined each
well-bound package with care, counted them and
then, in one fleeting thought, asked herself what
their contents might be. For the time, the roll of
papyrus was forgotten. Only one thing mattered
now—their cargo.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finding everything ship-shape she worked her way
back to the cabin door to stand there polishing her
glasses.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly she found herself staring at the square
of white with which the polishing was being done.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s not my handkerchief,” she exclaimed. “It
has embroidery in the corners, a date palm in one
corner and a flying bird in the other.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must have picked it up somewhere,” her
father suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>Digging into her purse for her own handkerchief,
she pulled out one more of the same pattern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” she exclaimed, “is getting funny.” Then:
“Oh! I remember. There was that strange bag last
night, you know? I needed a handkerchief. My bag
was gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you took those, and you have them still. Well,
you got something out of that adventure,” he laughed
good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>They were up and away at dawn. As the sun rose
over the gray hills, painting them with a golden
light, it seemed to Mary that now nothing could
hinder them from reaching their distant goal in far-away
China.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two days later, weary, bleary-eyed, but happy, she
found herself looking down on the rooftops and
strange towers of a great city. Like a broad ribbon
a river divided the city into two parts while, far
away, glimmering in the sun, lay the ocean.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” Sparky’s voice was hoarse with emotion,
“this is the heart of India.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As usual, they passed over the city to drop down
upon a secluded airport all but hidden by tropical
trees.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had made an overnight stop just within the
border of India. From that airport they had radioed
the probable hour of arrival. Mary was surprised to
see a small crowd of people race on the field as their
plane came to a stop.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, at last, she stood in the doorway of the
plane, blinking from the bright sun, there came a
loud roar of applause which fairly set her back on
her feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” She turned to Sparky. “They must
think we’re a big league baseball team or something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are a lot of Americans here,” he explained.
“That’s including the soldiers. You’re the first lady
member of the Ferry Command that’s ever showed
up here.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>“Ray! Ray! Ray! for the lady pilot,” a soldier
shouted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” came roaring back.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary said never a word, just stood there, blinking
in the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then an attractive young lady came up close. “I’m
Judy Pierce from the big school for girls here. I
heard you were to arrive and I wish you would be
my guest while you’re here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would be just fine—I—I—guess. How about
it and how long?” Mary asked Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ought to be swell. How long? That I can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a city,” Judy Pierce said. “We have
phones and everything. We can keep in touch with
you at the airport.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will be quite all right,” Sparky agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speech! We want a speech!” some boy from
Kansas, Iowa, or Oklahoma shouted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speech! Speech! Speech!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t make a speech,” Mary’s voice carried across
the field. “All I can do is to fly a plane, and I don’t
know too much about that. But it does make me feel
as if I had gone round the world and got back home
to see you all here. I know now, as I never knew
before, that the sun never really sets on the Army of
the U.S.A.”</p>

<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>There came one more roar of applause during
which Mary leaned over to say to her new-found
friend: “I’ll be ready in just a little while.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s fine,” Judy smiled. “I have my small car.
We’ll be in the city before you know it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! A car!” Mary exclaimed. “Then I must be
back home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that she dodged back into the plane. There
she came upon Sparky waving two envelopes in the
air.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sealed orders,” he whispered hoarsely. “One is
to be opened here. That’s got to be done before
you go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” Mary breathed. “Now we’ll know!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not all of it,” Sparky warned. “Only part, and
the least exciting part is my guess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They crowded back into a dark corner of the
plane, then shoulder to shoulder, heads close together,
read the note that came from the wax-sealed
envelope.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The boxes marked (C),” they read, “are to be
trans-shipped to the Burma front. They contain
quinine and should be guarded with the greatest
care.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quinine!” Mary dropped down upon a case
marked (C). “Is that what we’re risking our lives to
defend! Every drug-store has quinine!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not any more,” said Sparky. “The supply in
those cases came from thousands of druggists in the
U.S.A. They donated it to the men who are fighting
in the mosquito plagued swamps of Burma.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>“And don’t you think it doesn’t matter.” He shook
a finger. “At our last landing I saw a man who came
from those swamps. He was being sent home. They
thought he might live. But you should have seen
him! Oh, no! You shouldn’t. It was terrible to see
a skeleton that’s still alive. Malaria did it. Quinine
would have stopped it. Those dirty little Japs have
all the quinine trees in the world and that’s one way
they hope to win the world. That’s how they fight!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sparky!” Her voice was hoarse. “You’re
always wonderful. If that was all we came for it’s
enough—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it’s not. It’s only the beginning. There are
the boxes marked (D). We won’t know what’s in
them until we are at the foot of the Himalaya
Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, we hope, will be the beginning of the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” her voice was tense, “I’d like to take that
quinine to Burma.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can’t, not in our ship. This ship goes straight
through to China.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d like to see those fighting boys. That—well,
that would be sort of a reward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might be able to fix it,” he conceded. “Anyway,
I’ll try. Now you run along and have a good
time with your new friends. You’ve got it coming.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>“My best times always come in the hardest places.”
She was still thinking of Burma. For all that she left
the plane to join Judy Pierce in her bright little
sport car.</p>

  <h2 id='chap13' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>SNAKE CHARMER</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“It would really be a shame to pass right through
India without seeing any of it,” Judy said as they slid
smoothly over a paved street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I suppose so,” Mary agreed. “But business
is business. We haven’t much time. I must always
be in touch with Sparky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll arrange it that way,” Judy promised. “We’ll
not be away from the phone more than an hour at
any time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will be swell. You see, we have part of a
ship load of quinine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quinine!” Judy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s for Burma.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! You are a public benefactor! What a wonderful
privilege, to fly half way round the world to
bring health back to hundreds of our boys!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has its drawbacks,” Mary spoke slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me tell you later. Just now I’d like to sit
back and enjoy the sights.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do that. I’ll say never a word.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>For a full half hour after that they wound in and
out, from one gorgeous scene to another in a world’s
paradise. Beautiful residences set back among tropical
trees, little gardens where oranges and lemons
clung to branches like spheres of gold, narrow arched
bridges over which they glided—all these delighted
Mary’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The people were strange. Some were faultlessly
dressed Europeans, some dark-robed Mohammedans,
and some the slender, olive-complexioned Hindus.
But all, even the children, seemed bright, well-fed,
and gay.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why this is a golden paradise!” Mary exclaimed.
“I never dreamed that India could be like this!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It can’t,” said Judy. “Not all of it. In America
there are two sides of the railroad track. In India
there are the two sides to the river. This is the bright
side. I’ll show you the other side after tea. You need
to see that at dusk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll have to be getting back,” said Judy. “There
may be a phone call from that man Sparky. It must
be great traveling with a man like Sparky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it is!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must have lots of fun together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We do, on the job.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the rest of the time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The rest of the time he’s too busy taking care of
his engines.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So he sends you off alone to have all the fun,”
Judy laughed. “But when you’ve reached the journey’s
end—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>“Will we have fun!” Mary grinned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, here we are,” Judy swung the car into a
drive before a stately brick building. “This is the
school. Classes are over and all the teachers are waiting
to have tea with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They walked up the broad path that lay between
two rows of stately palms. Judy led Mary to her
own room, that she might wash and brush up, then
hurried away to ask about a phone call.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No call yet,” she said, as she returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen!” Mary held up a hand. From the sky
came a thunder of sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Big planes, a lot of them! Come on!” Seizing
Judy’s hand, Mary dragged her outside.</p>

<p class='c012'>There, looking up, they saw a large formation of
heavy bombers. All but breathless, Mary began to
count. “Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,” she
ended. “Judy! That’s the flight Sparky and I started
out with. We’re going to have company over the
mountains!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you’re going to need it,” Judy said soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Had Mary consulted her own wishes, she would
have hurried away to the airport, but courtesy decreed
that she remain at Judy’s tea, so Judy’s tea it
was, and not so bad after all.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>There were twenty-three teachers in the group
waiting to welcome Mary on the large, cool porch of
the teachers’ home. Some had gray hair and some,
like Judy, were young. One and all they were eager
to know more about the war and the lands they had
left behind.</p>

<p class='c012'>When tea had been served and they had chatted
informally for a short time, they led Mary to a large,
easy chair, and bolstered her up with cushions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said the dean, “you are our queen. We
each and every one of us demand an audience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A queen for an hour,” Mary laughed. “What is
it you wish to know and what is your supplication?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell me,” said a girl with glorious red hair, “I
have done some flying, oh! quite a bit. How may I
become a WAF and go flying around the world?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You probably can’t,” was the disturbing reply.
“I, it seems, am a person of special privilege or, perhaps
you might say, with a dark curse upon my head.
At least, until now, I am the only member of our
band who has turned into a world traveler.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if you are extremely serious—,” she added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I am!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I also,” came from another corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I,” came again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In that case,” said Mary, “all you have to do is to
get back to America.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very simple!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just a little hop.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>“Yes,” Mary agreed, “but whether I will make it,
or how, I don’t really know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When you are in America,” she went on, “make
sure you have five hundred hours of flying to your
credit, then step right in. There are rather rigid examinations.
After that you go through four weeks
of tireless basic training, learning how to be a soldier
and all that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then you get your wings?” the red head suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might call it that. After that you fly and fly
and fly, delivering all manner of planes to all sorts
of places all over U.S.A.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then,” Mary drew a long breath, “if you’ve
been a good girl and if the gods are kind, you get a
trip round the world, practically free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell us about this marvelous trip,” another girl
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary allowed herself a fleeting thought of all the
grand boys of the bombing flight waiting at the airport,
then launched herself into the bright, hilarious,
sober, breath-taking story of her journey. The crackup
in the Brazilian jungle, the beachcomber of Brazil,
the Jap spy, the Woman in Black, the battle over the
desert with Burt Ramsey as hero, the missing traveling
bag of Persia were all there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! That’s how it is!” the red head gasped when
Mary had finished.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>“No,” Mary laughed. “That’s how it was. Once
we have delivered our plane and cargo, I suspect that
we shall drift back to America on flowery beds of
ease and with never an adventure.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap14' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>THE CAST ASSEMBLES</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>As she left the cool shade of that porch, Mary was
thinking of just two things, her reunion with the men
of the big bomber flight and their plans for the immediate
future.</p>

<p class='c012'>One thing surprised her. When they had entered
the school an hour before, the sun had been shining
brightly. Now it was raining hard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a change!” she exclaimed as she and Judy
raced for the car.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the start of the rainy season,” Judy explained,
once they were inside the car, gliding along. “When
it starts it keeps right on. It’s too bad you didn’t
arrive a week sooner.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At this season of the year terrible storms sweep
over the Himalaya Mountains. You’ve got to cross
them, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it very dangerous?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They say it’s one of the most dangerous passes in
the world. Once a flight of five planes with Chinese
pilots started over the pass. Not one of them was
ever heard of again.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>“But then,” Judy hastened to add, “those were
small planes. You’ve got a real ship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mary thought, “we’ve got a real ship.” For
all that, she could not help recalling the many times
“real ships,” big passenger planes, had crashed against
the stone wall of the Rockies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Himalayas are much higher than the Rockies,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, much higher! One peak has never been
scaled. It’s been tried time and again. Many a poor
climber is buried beneath their snows.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary scarcely heard this last remark for the airport
loomed just ahead.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having bidden Judy good-by with a promise to
join her again in an hour, she found herself in the
midst of a veritable mob of U.S. airmen, who, in
their joy at seeing her, threatened to wreck her precious
flying hands, squeezed the life out of her and
talked her deaf and dumb, all in the same five minutes.</p>

<p class='c012'>After that, order was restored and they led her to
a back room. There they set her on a stool to join
her in a toast to the god of the Himalayas and the
future, drunk with honest-to-goodness American coffee.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the time she managed to drag Sparky into a
corner for a private conference, she was quite out of
breath.</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>“Sparky,” she spoke in a low tone, “as the crooks
would say, ‘what’s the lay?’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll be here for at least another day.” Sparky’s
brow wrinkled. “I don’t like it. The rainy season is
here. Every day it will get worse. We’ve made it this
far alone and, considering the circumstances, got on
pretty swell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure we have, Sparky—just wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But orders are orders,” Sparky sighed. “We’re
to go over with the rest of the flight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s so they’ll pull us off a mountain peak in
case we get stuck,” Mary suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something like that. That’s the toughest bit of
flying in the whole trip, so everything has to be a little
more than all right. Our ship is ready to go right
now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks to Sparky’s endless hours of toil.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky grinned. “Have it any way you like. The
other planes are not ready, won’t be for a day, sooo—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about the quinine?” Mary asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wanted to talk to you about that. There’s time
to get over to the Burma line and back before we
start.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sparky!” Her eyes shone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not with our plane,” he went on. “It’s too
risky. The balance of our cargo is the most important
part. Our ship must be in first class shape for that
last lap.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>“But can’t we borrow a smaller plane for the
Burma trip?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we might,” Sparky spoke slowly. “Thing
is, I hate to leave our ship and its cargo for a single
hour. You know all the things that have happened.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Sparky, I know.” Her voice was husky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve had a lot of luck, Mary.” He hesitated.
“Tell you what, you show up here just before dawn
tomorrow and we’ll see what can be cooked up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be here, Sparky. And now look! There’s my
car waiting for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve made some swell friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I sure have. See you in the morning.” She went
racing away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You look tired,” said Judy when they were once
again headed for the school. “How would you like
to take a nap in my room for a couple of hours?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will be just swell,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By that time it will be early twilight, just the
right time to visit the other side of the river.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes, the other side of the river.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s quite different, I assure you. When I am in
a strange little world I’ve never seen before, I like
to see it all, not just part of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, so do I.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, this time you’ll not see it all. No one has
ever seen all of India, but you can see the other side
of the river.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>They arrived at the school and soon, with the
shades drawn and door locked, Mary was drifting off
to the land of dreams.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she was awakened, it seemed she had just
fallen asleep, but a dash of cold water on her face
and a demitasse of very black coffee brought her back
to life.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll do the other side,” said Judy. “We’ll not
take too long for it. Then we’ll dine in one of those
strange, little restaurants. You may not like the food
but you’ll like the setting. The fruit is always good
and the tea—um!—such tea as you have never before
tasted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sounds all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And after that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“After that I’d like to run over to the airport for
just a moment. Won’t take long. Want to check on
some things.” Down deep in her heart Mary was
hoping that Sparky would have things all fixed for
her trip to Burma with the quinine. She really had
her heart set on that trip. To visit a real battlefield,
to see the men who for months had been fighting
in mud and blood for victory.</p>

<p class='c012'>That would be like visiting another world, something
she’d never forget. And to be able to tell some
of them that she had done a little, just a very little,
to bring them new health and happiness. Ah! That
surely would bring a thrill.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>She and Judy were crossing the bridge as she
thought all this. Arriving on the other side, she was
surprised and shocked. Here, it is true, were the
same grand, old palms, the sweeping drive and all
that. But the people and their homes! Here were
dirt, squalor, ragged children, slinking dogs, and
shaggy monkeys staring down at her from the trees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why don’t they kill the monkeys?” she asked.
“Then there would be more for the people to eat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! You can’t do that! If you killed just one
monkey you’d be mobbed.” Judy was shocked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In goodness name! Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The monkeys are sacred. Religion is a potent
force to these people. But don’t let’s get started on
that. Come on. Let’s go.” Judy hurried on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Each filled with her own, long thoughts they wandered
on and on. As the shadows darkened, the
streets narrowed. At last they were in the very heart
of the city.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look!” Mary whispered, suddenly gripping Judy’s
arm. “See that tall woman in the black dress?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, a Moslem.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman was moving across an open space
where the afterglow of the sun brought her out in
bold relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does she—would you say there was anything unusual
about her?” These words were said by Mary
in so tense a whisper that Judy turned to look at her.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>“Why, yes,” she replied slowly, “she is strange. I
should say that she doesn’t belong here at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How could you know that?” Mary asked in a
startled voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I teach art and I paint quite a bit. You know an
artist, a really good one, makes you conscious of a
beautiful figure, even though it is loaded down with
robes. It’s the way you sit and stand and move. That
woman does not belong here. I’ve never seen anyone
like her. There is a spring in her step. Her body is
like a tight wire. I’d hate to meet her in the dark.
I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then, as if conscious of the fact that she was
being talked about, the woman turned and looked
back.</p>

<p class='c012'>As if startled, she quickened her pace.</p>

<p class='c012'>To say that Mary was startled and alarmed would
be to put it very mildly. She was not dreaming that,
here in India, she had come across the Woman in
Black, and yet this woman did seem to have something
in common with her. It was strange.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on!” she whispered. “I want to see—” She
did not finish. What did she want to see? Perhaps
she did not know.</p>

<p class='c012'>She saw sooner than she wished. The woman had
turned a corner. As they appeared, rounding that
same corner, she made a sudden movement. Something
bright gleamed in her hand. In the nick of
time Mary dropped flat. There was a flash, and a report,
then a scream.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>Neither Mary nor Judy had screamed, though
Judy would have done so had she not lost her voice.
It was that woman who had screamed. Little wonder,
for a white man darting from a corner had knocked
the gun from her hand, then had made a grab for
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quicker than any cat, she bent low to escape his
grasp, then vanished into a dark and narrow street.</p>

<p class='c012'>After bending over to pick up the woman’s pistol,
the man walked toward the girls in long strides.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She almost got you that time, miss,” he spoke
gruffly. “Now, what would nice girls like you be doing
in such a place as this? And one of you in uniform!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say!” His tone changed. “You don’t happen to
be the young lady who helped bring that quinine
from America?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s who I am,” Mary admitted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say! You’re a real hero! Shake!” He gripped
her hand until it hurt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here,” he said, “take this gun. You may need
it.” He held out the pistol.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary dropped it into her pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’d she shoot at you for?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a long story.” Mary hesitated. “At least I
think it is.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>“Oh! It is? Then let’s get out of here. She might
come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With long, swinging strides he led the way out
of the narrow labyrinth of streets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What were <span class='fss'>YOU</span> doing back there?” Mary asked,
as they neared the river.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Me?” He laughed hoarsely. “That’s a good one.
Me, I’m a Flying Tiger. Nobody ever touches a Flying
Tiger. They don’t dare!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Flying Tiger!” Mary was thrilled. Judy
nodded her confirmation. Then she whispered:
“That’s what he is and one of the best!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’d be honorin’ me if you’d have a bite to eat
with me,” said Mary’s new-found friend. “Both of
you. I’m Scottie Burns and I’m with an American
squadron now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will be a pleasure,” Mary said. “And I’m
sure—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes,” Judy hastened to add. “It will be a
real joy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And will you name the place?” Scottie begged.
“I’m not so well acquainted here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Judy led them to a quiet place run by a native
Indian chef, who had spent several years in America
and who knew how to prepare Indian food as Americans
liked it.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a jolly and delightful occasion. After some
urging Scottie told with laughter and tears of his
experiences with the Flying Tigers.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>“That’s one spell in my life I’ll never forget,” he
concluded. “Never! Never! It was tough, but it
was glorious. When the last battle is won and the
last man of that brave band is laid away like a tattered
flag for keeps, we’ll be a-flyin’ and a-yarnin’
in that place where all good Indians go.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now,” he turned to Mary, “how about this
black-robed lady who wishes you were dead?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! It’s nothing at all, after what you’ve been
telling, but I’ll tell you all the same—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary told the story of her journey while Scottie
listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Young lady!” he exclaimed when she had finished,
“you’ve got what it takes!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m only one of the thousands of American
women who have joined up to help win the war,”
said Mary. “And they’ve all got what it takes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Glory be for that!” Scottie exclaimed. “Now I
know the fight will soon be over. When the ladies
get into Hitler’s hair there’s nothing left but the
shouting.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And here’s a secret.” He leaned forward and his
eyes shone. “There is talk of sending me to Burma
with that quinine early to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” Judy exclaimed. “That wouldn’t be fair.
Mary and Sparky should do it. They’ve earned the
right.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>“Exactly what I said,” Scottie agreed. “But
Sparky won’t risk his ship and he won’t leave the
rest of his cargo alone for an hour and as for this
young lady—” He hesitated, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course it wouldn’t be safe,” Mary stepped in.
“I don’t know the route. The quinine is too precious.
I wouldn’t think of risking it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course not,” Judy smiled. “But if Scottie
were sent with it and if he were to ask that you be
sent along as his co-pilot?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I’d accept!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You would?” Scottie exclaimed. “Then what’s
keeping us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only Sparky’s okay!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And orders from headquarters. I’ll get it all
fixed within the hour. Where’s my hat? Oh—oh,
yes, waiter! Waiter! Bring the checks!” With the
least possible ceremony and no apology, Scottie paid
the charge and bounded from the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Flying Tiger!” Judy exclaimed. “He flies
even when he’s on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same, I like him a lot.” Mary’s eyes shone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who wouldn’t? I envy you. That will be something
to remember—the trip.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything we do is something to remember,”
said Mary. “That’s why I like flying.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I had the flying hours I’d resign tomorrow and
join the WAFS.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>“You can get the necessary training at the
Woman’s Flying Training Detachment,” said Mary.
“Jacqueline Cochrane is the director.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll think about it,” Judy replied soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>They left the place to wander slowly back toward
the school. As they crossed the long bridge, the dark
waters of the river sweeping beneath them seemed
to whisper of the thousands who had swarmed its
banks since time began.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know,” said Mary, “I am obsessed with
a strange notion that this black-robed woman who
shot at me tonight is a French woman I saw at the
port we reached after we had flown the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In North Africa!” Judy exclaimed. “That’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I suppose so but I seem to have been
haunted by women in black all the way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s possible and it is also possible that they
were all spies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they were all so very much alike,” Mary
insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Judy, “is even probable. I have a
friend, here in India, who is a counter-spy. He told
me once that women spies were all very much alike,
that is, the successful ones were. They are smart, he
says, keen in their own way, usually well educated
and all that. Their smartness is like the smartness of
a dagger, if you can say a dagger is smart.” Judy
paused to reflect.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>“Smart as a dagger,” Mary murmured. “That does
sound a little strange.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Smart and beautiful,” said Judy. “I have a
friend who has a collection of what he calls ‘beautiful
daggers.’ They <i>are</i> beautiful too, hilts of gold,
some with pearls set in silver, mother-of-pearl handles
and a lot more. But they all have one thing in
common, an ugly, dangerous blade. Women spies
are alike, I suppose, in very much the same way.
That’s why this one seems like the others.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Probably so,” Mary agreed. “But say! I’d like
to go over and see Sparky before we go to bed. He
might have something more to tell me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll drive you over,” Judy volunteered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all fixed, Mary,” were Sparky’s first words to
her when she reached the airport. “That Flying
Tiger, Scottie, will fly with you to Burma first thing
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Scottie’s a fast worker.” Mary was pleased.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He sure is, and a good one. They say he’s downed
more Japs than anyone in China, and he’s barely
twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Twenty-two years old!” She stared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right. They grow old fast over here. But
he’ll turn young again when this is over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” her voice dropped, “if I shouldn’t come
back, you can get a good co-pilot to go with you on
that last lap to our journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>“Oh, sure! But you’ll come back, Mary. If I
wasn’t dead certain of that I’d never let you go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! So that’s the way it is,” Mary laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You bet your life, it is. We’re going to finish this
thing, you and I.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I want you to go with Scottie,” he added.
“You’ve had a lot of grief on this trip. I want you to
see just how worthwhile it is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, Sparky.” Her voice went husky. Their
hands met in a good stout grip.</p>

<p class='c012'>A half hour later Mary crept between cool, white
sheets in the teachers’ home at the school, prepared
for a good sleep before the dawn of one more big day.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap15' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>BURMA DETOUR</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>When Mary arrived at the airport before dawn
next morning, guards, like gray ghosts, were moving
silently about among the many planes assembled
there.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having been challenged by one of the guards, she
explained her mission and was at once led to a cabin
monoplane that was just warming up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! There you are!” Scottie exclaimed. “I hope
you’re ready for a bit of a scrap or anything that
comes along.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m with you for anything that comes our way,”
she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good!” said Scottie. “Well, then let’s get up and
get going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Climbing to his place, he released the mechanic
who had put his plane in motion, then motioned
Mary to the co-pilot’s seat.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a small plane alongside yours,” he said.
“We had to break up some of the boxes of quinine
and store the goods in the wings, but it’s all there.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>“Listen to her!” he exclaimed, as the motor roared.
“Snortin’ to go! She’s the sweetest ship I’ve ever
flown. She’ll jump right straight up from the ground,
or nearly so, and can land on any road a car can run
on. She can do four hundred miles an hour, flying
straight on, and can cut circles around any Jap plane
that’s made. I only wish I could show you what a
fighter she is, but they say all’s quiet on the Burma
Front.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please don’t stir it up on my account.” Mary
laughed a bit nervously. “All I’m interested in is
getting that quinine to the hospital—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure!” Scottie agreed heartily. “That’s our mission
and that’s what we’ll do, but downing a couple
of Zeros won’t hurt a bit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed to Mary as they rose to greet the dawn,
that he had spoken the exact truth. His ship did appear
to leap straight into the air like a frightened
bird.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad Sparky is getting a chance to have a real
rest at last,” she said after a time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I imagine he can use it, all right,” said Scottie.
“He told me he was going to sleep late. After
that he and one of the boys at camp will fly your
plane to the foot of the mountains. We’ll meet them
there late today.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And tomorrow we’ll go over the Himalayas?”
Mary drew in a long, deep breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, providing the mountain gods permit you.
They don’t always, not by a long ways.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>“Is it really bad?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the toughest bit of flying between China and
Chicago. Every pilot who’s done the trip says so.
And there’s a score or more of men who’ve flown it
many times. Help is coming to China from America
in a big way—by plane. And I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So are we all!” Mary agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>For an hour they sailed on over green fields of rice
and dark, tangled forests.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a storm gathering over there,” Scottie
nodded in the direction they were going. “Hope we
can beat it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were over a broad stretch of water now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s getting really black over the jungle where
those Jap rats are hiding.” Scottie set his motor roaring.
“They’ll not bother us today.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As Mary watched the gathering storm she thought
she saw small planes, like birds circling before the
clouds. “Scurrying home,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had reached the far side of the water when,
with startling suddenness, the storm struck. Catching
their plane as if it were a wisp of paper, the wind
whirled it up—up—up a thousand, two, three thousand
feet, then sent it whirling down again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just hold your seat,” Scottie’s lips were drawn
into a straight line. “I’ve been all through this before.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>When their downward rush had slackened, he kept
the plane headed toward the earth. “We’re still at
five thousand feet,” he murmured. “Might be a
bright spot below.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All the time Mary was thinking, “We’ve come all
that long way with the quinine and now—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly, she let out a little cry of joy. From the
very blackness of night that was the heart of a storm
cloud, they leaped into clear, bright air.</p>

<p class='c012'>Better still, beneath them lay a large clearing and
at its far end, half hidden, was a small airfield.</p>

<p class='c012'>Scottie spoke a few words into his radio. Mary
caught the answer:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on down, you monkey. What you want to
do, stay up there and get wet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Roaring with laughter Scottie set the plane circling
down. The next minute their plane bump-bumped
and they slid in for a stop.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here we are!” Scottie exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and here comes the rain,” was Mary’s answer
as big drops began beating a tattoo on their
fuselage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Three minutes later, while the rain was coming
down in torrents a laughing young doughboy carrying
slickers on his arm climbed to the plane’s cabin
to thrust in his head for a look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I win!” he shouted to someone standing in a tent
door. “You lose your two bucks. She’s a lady! And,
boy, oh, boy! Is she!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>There came a roar from the distant tent, then the
boy crowded past the boxes of quinine to hold out
the slickers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here. Get into these,” he urged. “We heard
about your coming and about the quinine. You
won’t be here long. Gotta make every moment
count.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Smiling happily, Mary hid herself in a slicker six
sizes too big, then raced away to the tent where she
found a score of young men, most of them with full
beards, singing:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It ain’t going to rain no more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The instant she appeared the song broke off short.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here she is! Danny!” her escort shouted. “Now
where’s the two bucks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You gotta take that raincoat off her before I’m
convinced,” came the defiant reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a happy smile Mary threw aside her raincoat.</p>

<p class='c012'>There came a succession of low gasps, then whispers:
“It is! It’s a gal pilot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that a tall doughboy shuffled forward. “We
drew straws,” he began bashfully. “I lost so I’ve got
to make you a speech. We—we all want to thank you
for the quinine. A lot of our buddies are in the hospital.
We’ve been out of quinine for a week and,—and
who knows which of us goes on sick leave next
so—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>“As you were—” Mary’s voice faltered, then steadied.
“You should know that we gals in the army ask
only one thing, to be treated as buddies and—and
regular soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This speech was received with a round of cheers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on, boys!” shouted a husky sergeant who
beyond doubt had crashed many a football line.
“Give her the hero’s rush.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that they hoisted her to their shoulders and
heading into the drenching rain, carried her away to
the hospital.</p>

<p class='c012'>There, safely hidden away at the edge of the jungle,
they put her down in a big tent packed full of
cots and on every cot rested an invalid soldier.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Boys,” said the sergeant, “we’ve brought you the
two best things in the world, plenty of quinine and
a lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speech! Speech!” came from every corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, boys,” Mary was close to tears, “I’m a flier,
not a chaplain. All I can say is that I shall always
remember this as the happiest moment of my life.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One thing more before I leave. I’d like your
names and addresses. If I’m lucky enough to get back
to good, old U. S. A., I’ll write to your mothers,
every one of them and tell them that I saw you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” exclaimed a very young boy close beside
her, “that—that will be swell!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>With aching heart but smiling face Mary went
from cot to cot collecting addresses and personal messages
of the sick men.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Scottie came in. “I’m sorry,” he apologized.
“The rain has stopped. There’s just time for a bit
of chow with the other boys here, then we’ll have to
hop into the sky. Don’t forget that Sparky’s waiting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” she exclaimed. “We must get going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A roar of farewell from the soldiers a half hour
later, a burst of speed and once again they were in
the air.</p>

<p class='c012'>For some time they were silent, then Mary said in
a solemn voice:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Scottie, I saw things in that field hospital today
that I hope I may never see again, but I’ll never forget
them. Never! Never!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know,” Scottie replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was another long silence. Then Scottie
spoke: “I don’t often speak of it. War’s not a thing
to be talked about, really, especially when you’re
talking to a girl. But did you happen to notice those
two boys in the far right-hand corner of the hospital?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I talked to them. Such nice boys. Both college
men. They were fliers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and ‘were’ is exactly the word. Neither of
them will ever fly again and one will never even
walk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Terrible,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>“It is terrible.” Scottie’s voice rose. “They were
my buddies, those boys were. More than once we
flew in the same formation. We were together when
it happened. Want me to tell you?” he hesitated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, tell me.” Her voice was low.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, those boys were flying a two seater, one was
pilot, the other radioman and gunner. We were
four planes together on patrol. Ten Zeros dropped
down upon us from the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! The clouds!” Mary looked up. Large,
white clouds left by the storm were hovering above
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a hot fight,” Scottie went on. “I got me
two Zeros, sent them down in flames. Having one
more burst of fire I went after one more Zero. He
was a tough one. Got in a burst of slugs on me and
cut half my ship’s tail away. But I gave him one
that set one of his wings shaking like a dead leaf.
With my guns empty, I was heading for home and
wondering if I’d get there, when I saw a good American
two-seater going down in flames.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘It’s the end of those boys,’ I thought. Then I
saw two parachutes blossom out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did they make it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They would have.” Scottie hesitated. “You might
not believe me, but those boys would tell you if you
asked them—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why? What—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>“The Jap that shot them down followed them,
followed until their parachutes opened up and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shot them up—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s what he did. Me? I was so mad I went
after him and without ammunition and with a shot-up
tail I’d have got him too if I’d had to ram him,
but he hid in a cloud.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And didn’t anyone get him?” Mary asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not that day, they didn’t, nor ever I guess. We’d
know his plane if we got him and I’d know him in
the air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How could you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The impudent monkey had the nose of his plane
painted to represent our Uncle Sam with a long
beard and a very red nose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Giving you something to shoot at, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me see the target just one more time,” Scottie
exclaimed, “and I’ll make a bull’s eye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For a long time after that Mary sat staring dreamily
down at the tropical beauty that glided beneath
them and thinking of the people who, like bits of
the jungle, had come and gone in her life during the
days that had just passed. She saw again Jerry, the
beachcomber, The Woman in Black, Captain Ramsey,
and her father. A dozen other familiar figures
passed before her mind’s eye. And then of a sudden,
Scottie exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>“Look! There’s four of those black-hearted, little
goggle-eyes slipping out of a cloud right now! I don’t
suppose—” he hesitated. “Of course we can run, or
we can climb. They’d never come near us. Perhaps
that’s the best way. There’s Sparky waiting for you,
and your cargo.” There was a wistful note in his
voice. It was, Mary thought, like the singing note
of a faithful dog’s whine when he was begging to be
loosened for a fight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky can wait, if need be—forever.” Her voice
was firm. “The cargo will go through even if I’m
not there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go get them, Scottie!” Her words came short
and quick.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You asked for it.” His motor roared. “So did
they.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The four Zeros, sure that one of them would finish
Scottie off, came right at them. As if by thundering
straight on he hoped to avoid them, Scottie did not
change his course until he was almost beneath them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, with a “Hang on, Mary!” he tilted his plane
straight up to climb toward the stars.</p>

<p class='c012'>Caught off guard, the attackers attempted to scatter.
One narrowly escaped crashing into the other
and, in the confusion, found Scottie beneath him,
with every gun blazing. With its fuselage sawed half
in two, the Zero doubled up to go rolling and tumbling
toward the jungle far below.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>Just in time Scottie dropped the nose of his plane,
tilted, and went into a spiral to escape an enemy on
his tail.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he came out of the spiral, he stood for a
second on his wing, then rising like a comet, flashed
past the would-be attacker to catch a second Zero
unawares and send him down in a pillar of smoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then a stream of slugs cut across their cabin,
so close to their backs that Mary felt the heat of their
passing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dirty—” Scottie did not finish. As the other
plane flashed past him, he had seen something. Mary
had seen it, too.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get him, Scottie,” she screamed. “Get him if it’s
the last thing you ever do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never doubt it!” In deathly fear lest his ship had
suffered from the attackers’ bullets he set his motor
thundering her best as he set himself to beat the Zero
to a cloud a mile or so away.</p>

<p class='c012'>They gained. They halved the distance between
them. They quartered it. The plane seemed a thing
alive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get him, Scottie! Get him!” she cried hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a long chance but just as the enemy touched
the edge of the cloud, Scottie let go. A burst of fire,
another, then another.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Zero had completely disappeared, when the
last burst roared from his guns.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>Ten seconds passed, twenty, thirty, then, down
from the cloud, as if the cloud itself were falling
apart, came broken bits of something that once had
been a Zero fighter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just blasted him apart!” Scottie muttered.
“Can you beat that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That picture of Uncle Sam on his plane’s nose—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, Mary? That picture!” Scottie laughed
hoarsely. “That’s blasted into bits. His engine must
have blown up or his gas tank or both!”</p>

<p class='c012'>A half hour later, as they circled for a landing over
the field where Sparky awaited them, Scottie said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the use of a good, American flier being
over Burma without doing a little fighting, even if
she is a lady?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fighting, Scottie?” said Mary. “I haven’t been
fighting. Just had a ride with a Flying Tiger, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And one you’ll not forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not ever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so they came on down.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap16' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVI</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>“ME GOT MACHINE GUN!”</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>In the meantime, with a borrowed co-pilot, Sparky
had made his way to a hidden airbase at the foot of
the mountains. Since the co-pilot had made the
flight several times before the trip was accomplished
without mishap or adventure.</p>

<p class='c012'>The moment they landed a Chinese boy, hopping
along on one leg and a crutch, came out to greet
them and guide them back into the bush where living
quarters had been established.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” he exclaimed after looking into the cabin.
“Somebody say mebby lady flier come. Mebby somebody
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They were not mistaken,” said Sparky. “The
lady pilot belongs to this plane. She’s coming later
with Scottie Burns.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Scottie!” the boy exclaimed. “Very good
flier, Scottie, mebby seventy Japs he shoot down, me
not know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s a great record,” said Sparky. “What’s your
name, boy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Me, Hop Sing. Alla time me hop—sometimes me
sing.” The boy laughed at his misfortune.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>“You’re all right.” Sparky laughed with him.
“How did you lose your leg?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Zero plane come down,” the boy swept the air
with an arm, “came zoom! Zoom! Zoom! Machine
gun—rat-tat-tat, go down me. Too many times shot.
American hospital doctors fix up. Now, me, I got
machine gun. Want Zero come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You Chinese people have been taking the rap for
us all these long years,” Sparky said soberly. “Now—here
we are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very soon come many big planes,” said the boy.
“Mebby bomb Tokio.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe yes, maybe no,” Sparky said.</p>

<p class='c012'>After looking the plane over carefully, then locking
it up tight, they made a dash through the pelting
rain where a warm welcome and a good American
dinner awaited them.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Mary and Scottie came zooming down on
the hidden airfield, they found Sparky waiting for
them. In a jeep he whisked them away to a little
eating place where they had coffee and sandwiches
and where Sparky listened to their rather amazing
story.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I had been with you when you visited that
hospital,” Sparky said when the story was told.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I wish you could have been!” Mary exclaimed
with real feeling. “It was sad but just wonderful.
I’d go around the world three times just to
do that much for our fine boys, who seem to feel that
they are sort of forgotten over here.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>“You took a long chance?” Sparky said to Scottie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When we went for that Jap after our plane had
been shot up?” Scottie spoke slowly. “Yes, that’s
right, we did. But if you had seen that Jap in his
plane with Uncle Sam’s face painted where it was
and you knew what that rat of a monkey had done,—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right,” Sparky grinned, “I’d have gone
after him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you would,” Mary agreed. “Any real
man would have done just that. There are some
things in this war that can be passed up. Others are
on the must-be-done list, and that was one of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But Sparky,” she leaned forward eagerly, “what
comes next? When do we cross the mountains?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tomorrow morning if the mountain storm gods
permit,” was his reply. “This afternoon, however, I
have a little trip to make.” He turned to Scottie.
“Do you know the road to a town called Gonagona?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” said Scottie, “I’ve been there several
times.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s an officer over there with secret orders
for us,” Sparky explained. “It has something to do
with our landing place once we are over the mountains.
I must get over there. Will you drive me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Sure!” Scottie grinned.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>“We’ll leave Mary in charge of the plane,” said
Sparky. “Think you can manage that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What am I to guard it from in this wild place?”
Mary asked. “The Monkeys of the Snows or something?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You never can tell,” Sparky did not smile. “And,
by the way, there’s a one-legged Chinese boy who will
help you out in a pinch. He has a sub-machine gun
that someone loaned him. It’s a businesslike affair
and I shouldn’t wonder if he could shoot it. He’s
looking for a low-flying Zero plane. Perhaps you can
find one for him. He calls himself Hop Sing. Sometimes
he hops and sometimes he sings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He sounds interesting,” said Mary. “Please tell
him to come around.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A half hour later Sparky and Scottie motored
away, leaving Mary seated on a fallen palm tree at
the edge of the narrow airfield.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary dreamed of many things, of wide, black
waters, sifting desert sands, glorious dances in
Egypt, Persian gardens, and many more. But suddenly
she was startled from her dreaming by a high-pitched
voice saying;</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are the so beautiful flying lady and I am Hop
Sing. Me, I got machine gun. Many times practice.”
Aiming the gun at a tree the Chinese boy seemed
about to mow it down but, instead, merely clicked
his gun. “Can shoot very well. Come Zero plane,
flying very low, I show you plenty.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>“I’m glad to see you, Hop Sing.” She slid down
from her log. “You’ll protect me from the monkeys,
won’t you?” she added with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Monkeys not hurt white lady,” was his laughing
reply. “Only monkeys wearing glasses, they hurt
white lady, but <i>not</i> hurt white lady. Me, I shoot
them, all-a-same them shoot me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary took to Hop Sing at once. She enjoyed his
happy, squirrel-like chatter. He told her many
amusing stories of the war, how his people had
learned to trick the Japs and lead them away from
their goals, how they had hidden their food to return
for it and so save their own lives. He told her too of
things that made her blood run cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can you be so happy when such terrible
things are going on?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No happy, bye-um-bye dead, that’s all,” was his
way of saying that happiness, come what may, is a
human necessity.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a time Hop Sing wandered away. Taking a
seat on the plane’s right wing, Mary sat dreaming in
the bright tropical sunlight until, with startling suddenness
a powerful twin-motored plane appearing to
come from nowhere circled once then swept down
upon the field.</p>

<p class='c012'>The plane came to a halt not thirty paces from
where she sat. Immediately four big men in officers’
uniforms leaped from the plane.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>“This the plane that arrived today from Calcutta?”
The younger of the four pointed at Sparky’s plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wouldn’t know.” There was something about
these men that Mary didn’t like. She was thinking,
‘What’s this’?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is this plane’s pilot?” the man demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“See here!” The man took a step forward. “We
just came over the mountains from China. We were
sent to pick up the cargo of that plane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is imperative that we have it at once.” An
older man took up the story. Mary did not like his
accent. He certainly did not come from America.
“There has been far too much delay,” the man went
on. “Bah! A woman for a co-pilot. What can you
expect?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are to take off that cargo at once,” said the
younger man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And fly it to China,” the other added.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary, who had been studying their plane, made
no reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” The younger man took a step forward.
Mary backed away, then stood her ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great silence had fallen over the jungle. From
far away came the scream of a parrot. Mary’s low-spoken
words scarcely broke the silence:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>“I have orders to guard this plane until the man
who flies it returns. He’ll be back in a half hour. If
you’ve come from China you might like a cup of
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Preposterous!” The older man’s face purpled.</p>

<p class='c012'>The younger man took another step forward but
this time Mary did not retreat. She just stood there
looking him squarely in the eye as she said, “Why
so preposterous? What does this mean, your swooping
down like this? I haven’t been long in the Orient
and I’m only a girl but all this seems strange and,—irregular.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Irregular!” the older man stormed. “You can’t
run a war in this country in what you call a regular
way. You must sometimes act in a hurry. China
cannot wait, so please step aside.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am remaining where I am,” she declared
stoutly. “Anyway, I don’t have the key to the plane.
I may be right, then again I may be wrong. If I am
wrong, I may lose my wings but you’ll have to come
and take me if you want the cargo of this plane.”
Outwardly Mary was calm but inside, she was all
atremble.</p>

<p class='c012'>The younger man’s lips twitched. “Such stupidity!”
he muttered, as his hand slipped toward a something
that showed black beneath his belt. Mary
trembled but did not move.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>At that instant there came a sound from behind
the plane. “Who can that be?” Mary asked herself.
Her heart gave a great leap as she heard a thin voice
say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I got me a tommy gun. I can shoot him very
good. Wanna see?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Before Mary could stop him Hop Sing sent out a
burst of fire that burned the air above the four men’s
heads.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You little Chinese rat,” the older man stormed.
“You—” He broke off short. The gleam in Hop
Sing’s eyes at that moment was a terrible thing to see.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hop Sing’s burst of gunfire, following as it did the
arrival of an unidentified airplane, brought a score
of officers, soldiers, and mechanics rushing to the
scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s all this?” Captain Noble, the officer in
charge of the field, demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir,” said Mary, forgetting to salute, “these
men say they’re from China. They say they have
orders to take the cargo from Sparky’s plane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s see your orders,” the Captain said, turning
to the four men.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, Captain.” The younger of the four
drew a sheath of papers from his pocket. “Here they
are, Captain.” He shot Mary an ugly look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Boy!” Mary thought. “If I’m wrong, I’ll
be washed out of this man’s Army, just like that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hm!” said the Captain. “Papers seem all in order.
Suppose you’d like a cup of coffee before you
start back?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>“There’s not much time—we—” The younger man
frowned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time enough for a cup of coffee.” The Captain’s
smile was disarming. “Are you guarding the plane?”
he asked Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I—I and Hop Sing.” She nodded toward the
Chinese boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Unlock the cabin and start unloading the cargo.
These boys will help you.” The Captain nodded to
the group of mechanics.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary’s heart sank. Then she remembered something.
“The cabin’s locked,” she said quietly.
“Sparky has the key.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Sparky? Oh, yes, he went to see the
Major. I’m afraid we can’t do a thing until the pilot
returns.” The Captain smiled once again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Break the lock,” the older man snarled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know that cannot be done.” The Captain
did not smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>At a slight nod from the younger men, the four
moved toward the plane that had brought them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Oddly enough, with just no orders at all, but with
guns ready for action, the soldiers of the Captain’s
squad lined up in front of that plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think,” the younger of the four licked his lips,
“we’ll accept your offer of hospitality.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten minutes later, when Sparky returned, he went
at once into a huddle with the Captain.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>A half hour later the four men returned to their
plane but four armed doughboys went there with
them. The Captain and a co-pilot took charge of
the plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mary, you’re a wonder!” Sparky exclaimed as
that plane climbed the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who are they?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Sparky, “is a military secret.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are they going?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t exactly know.” Sparky smiled. “One
thing I’m sure of, and that is they won’t come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One thing still puzzles me,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s that,” Sparky asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did the Captain order me to open the
plane’s cabin door for those men?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps he knew you didn’t have the key. Then
again he may have known you wouldn’t use it if you
did have it. Either way he was right. What he wanted
was to avoid any shooting, and he got that. I
wouldn’t trade you and Hop Sing for four Lieutenant
Colonels and a General,” Sparky laughed.
“And you’re both going with us to China.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” said Mary, “will be swell!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Later that day when they were together once more,
Sparky and Mary lingered long over their tea in a
little place run by a friend of Hop Sing.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Mary had told her story all over again,
Sparky’s admiration for his co-pilot was greater than
ever before.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>“Listen!” She held up her hand. The air was
filled with sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The bombers are here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that means—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That we go over the mountains tomorrow providing
the storm gods smile.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap17' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>IN SWIFT PURSUIT</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>That night, lying on a cot in a tent shared with
three Red Cross nurses, Mary did not fall asleep at
once. The day had been a tremendous one. Much
that war means had come crashing in upon her. At
the field hospital she had seen what war could do to
fine American boys. She had not known that she
could feel so terribly sad and yet keep on smiling
as she had done as she moved from cot to cot.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand she had never been quite so
happy in her life as she was on realizing that she had
helped them in a big way by bringing the quinine
from America and that she could serve them still
more by contacting their relatives and friends in
America, when she got back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I do get back,” she whispered. Watching Scottie
down those Jap fighters who so richly deserved to
die, she had realized as never before how easy it was
for a life, just any life, her life, to go out like a match
in a high wind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But my life must not go out yet,” she told herself,
almost fiercely. “I have so much to do—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>She thought again of the messages she was carrying
to America, and, strangely enough, of the roll of
papyrus. She could not but feel that this roll was
somehow very important.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most important of all was the cargo. “It must go
through!” she told herself. “We’ve only a little farther
to go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After dinner that night she had sat on a log beside
the stout-hearted Hop Sing. He had told her how
his people had suffered through all those long years,
of the speechless cruelties of the Japs, of homes destroyed,
women and children reduced to slavery, and
all the rest. And now help was coming—not enough
yet—but more and more help.</p>

<p class='c012'>What was the cargo they carried? Once again this
question came up to intrigue but not to disturb her.
Neither she nor Sparky had tried hard to guess the
answer. “We shall know,” she assured herself. “It
won’t be long now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Why were all those bombers heading for China in
such haste? Would they help retake Burma and with
it the Burma Road? Would they help defend Russia
from possible Jap attack? Would they bomb Tokio?
She could not guess the answer, but having visited
that field hospital, she hoped as never before that
they were headed for Tokio.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’d love to go with them,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But first the mountains,” she whispered. Scottie
had told her of the pass, how during the monsoon
period great storms went roaring up the sides of those
highest mountains of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>“You can’t imagine it.” Those were his words.
“Snow rising like smoke a thousand, two, three thousand
feet from their peaks. A plane caught in the
grip of such a storm is like a chip caught in a great
whirlpool.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Shivering at the very thought, Mary drew the covers
close about her and at last fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was awake an hour before dawn and, disturbed
by an overpowering sense of something wrong, drew
on her clothes and walked outside. It was dark,
gloomy, and chilly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did I leave my cozy bed?” she asked herself
as she walked across the narrow airfield and then
among the shadows of many planes to search out
their own.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There you are,” she whispered at last. “Good,
old ship!”</p>

<p class='c012'>To her surprise she saw that the door stood slightly
ajar. Instantly her curiosity was aroused. Sparky,
she knew, had not slept in the ship. For all that, he
may have arisen early to look things over before the
big day. That there were guards about she knew
quite well, though she had not been challenged.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, she told herself, was not strange. The moon
was down. It was the darkest hour before dawn.
There were more planes on the field than ever before
in its history. No one would risk a light.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>And yet, as she came close to their plane, she
thought she caught a faint flicker inside its cabin.
This did not startle her. Sparky was still in her
mind. She would surprise him. It would be nice to
spend an hour with him in their own ship before
dawn on a day that should mean much to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>With noiseless footsteps, she reached the plane,
then climbed two rounds of the boarding ladder.
Without a sound, she opened the door half way to
peer into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Did some good gremlin whisper, “Wait?” Who
can say? She did wait. And then—she barely suppressed
a gasp. The gleam of a tiny flashlight reflected
by some bright object faintly illuminated a
face within the cabin. It was not Sparky, not a man
at all, but a woman. “The Woman in Black,” she
thought, nearly falling from the ladder. She was sure
that this was the woman who had fired a shot at her
back there in the city.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fascinated, she watched. The woman had torn
the top from a corrugated box containing a unit of
their precious cargo and was studying it intently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” Mary thought, “must be stopped.” Her
heart beat a wild tattoo.</p>

<p class='c012'>In her excitement, she must have made some slight
sound. The light blinked out. There came the
sound of rushing feet and before she could think or
move, she was knocked from the ladder.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>Landing on her head, she was knocked unconscious
momentarily. But something made her mind
fight back. When her senses started returning she
could think and hear but could neither move nor
speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>She heard steady, approaching footsteps. “A
guard,” she thought. “Oh! If I could only scream.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With a violent effort she brought back her power
of motion. Sitting up, she <i>did</i> scream. It was not a
loud scream but enough for a voice said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mary! What are you doing here? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! Oh! I’m so glad!” She staggered to her
feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” He was near now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Lady in Black! She was in the plane. She
broke open a box. She knows the secret of our cargo.
She—she’s a spy. Perhaps she has the roll of papyrus.
She will escape and she must not!</p>

<p class='c012'>“There!” Her voice rose as there came the sound
of an airplane motor. “There’s a plane! Someone
is with her. They must have stolen a plane. They
will get away!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Two guards came racing up. “Oh! It’s you!” the
taller of the two said. “What’s up? What happened?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A woman spy was going over the cargo of our
plane!” exclaimed Mary. “She saw too much. She
may have taken something with her. We’ve got to
catch her.”</p>

<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>“That must be her plane warming up!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did she have a plane? Why was she allowed to
land?” Sparky demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No plane has come in tonight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then she and her accomplice are planning to
steal a plane. Come on! We may catch them yet!”
Sparky led the way on the run.</p>

<p class='c012'>But they were too late. As they reached the runway,
the stolen plane went gliding over the cement
to rise into the air.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s a fast two-seater. You’ll need a fast one
to overtake them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll take Scottie’s plane!” Mary exclaimed.
“It’s gassed and oiled, ammunition, everything. I
helped him get it in shape last night. It’s really fast
and a real fighter!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on, then!” Once again Sparky led the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>The moment his feet hit the ship’s deck, he had
the motor singing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Mary,” he called. “Not much time.
What about your jacket, oxygen mask, and all
that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’re all here. Scottie’s are there, too, for
you. We left them. I—I don’t know why.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s great! Get in and let’s ramble. Okay,
boys, turn us loose!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>Blocks were removed from before the wheels. The
motor thundered, then slowed to an even grind.
They glided away, faster—faster—faster. Then up
they shot into the sky to greet the dawn that “comes
up like thunder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There they are!” Mary exclaimed. “Heading
straight for the mountains!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What luck! They can’t lose us now. We’ll follow
them straight to China if we have to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we only had our plane!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps it’s best that we haven’t. This may be
tougher than you imagine. And this plane is faster
than our own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s right!”</p>

<p class='c012'>As they sped on the sun rose. The sky was crystal
clear. Far ahead of them, triangles of deep purple
where shadows lay and of light yellow where sunlight
fell, were the mountains.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Beautiful,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Beautiful and terrible,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’re gaining,” she said after a time. “I can
see them much more plainly. If we catch up with
them—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary could not go on. She was wondering how far
this chase would take them and how it was to end.
Sparky had said they were headed for China. Part
of China was in Allied hands. Much of it was held
by the Japs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>“They’ll lead us over Jap-held territory.” She
spoke aloud. “And then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fighters may come out to meet us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If they do we’ll shoot them down,” she declared
fiercely. “You should have seen Scottie in this very
plane yesterday. It was wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have all the luck,” said Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” she leaned toward him. “Suppose we
don’t come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“From this trip? We will, Mary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But suppose we don’t. What about our plane
and its cargo?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Scottie knows all about that. He’ll take it
through. None of us is absolutely necessary, but we’ll
come back, Mary. We’ll take our own plane to the
journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look!” She pointed toward the other plane that
momentarily grew larger in their field of vision.
“They’ve changed their course. They’re heading
down the mountain range.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Toward the highest peak of all,” said Sparky.
“The one nobody’s ever climbed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary had read of this peak and the futile attempts
men had made to scale it. She had been thrilled
then. But now, she shuddered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They hope to tire us, run us out of gas, something.”
Sparky tested his supply of fuel. “They’ve
got a long way to go yet. But we must be careful. A
forced landing on these white slopes means death!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>“We must save enough gas to take us back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once more Mary’s mind was working. Was this
to be an endurance race, endurance of plane, of fuel,
and human courage?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hardly that,” she told herself. “We should be
up with them in less than a half hour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Through the clear air they could see great distances.
Far ahead, perhaps a hundred miles, stood a
peak much higher than the rest. Was this the highest
peak of all? She had no way of telling. And so they
sped on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten minutes passed, fifteen, twenty—they were
nearing the fleeing plane. The lofty peak was very
near.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky studied his fuel gages.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In twenty minutes we must turn back or run the
risk of crashing among these peaks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Or in jungles at the mountain bases.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They came nearer, ever nearer to the spy and her
plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A burst of fire might bring them down even
now,” said Sparky. But his fingers did not reach for
the gun controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>Five minutes more. They must decide. To turn
back meant defeat. Could they face that? Or should
they turn loose the fury of their guns?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>But what was this? The fleeing plane faltered,
began to fall, then righted itself and flew on. Ten
tense seconds passed and again it faltered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They stole the plane.” Sparky’s voice was solemn
as Moses. “They did not take time to check the
ship’s fuel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again the plane picked up speed, only once
and then, like a kite that has lost its tail, the plane
began to fall, slowly at first, then faster and faster,
turning over and over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She was a spy,” Mary said, forcing her eyes away
from the sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next time she looked, the plane was all but
upon the mountain, the snow-packed slope. She saw
it crash, then begin rolling over and over. Down it
spun, a thousand, two, three thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>They followed it part way down. Once it leaped
across an open space, to crash again, then to roll on.</p>

<p class='c012'>When at last it came to rest a faint film of smoke
came up from it. This grew dense, then burst into a
red flame. They watched. Nothing moved.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The end,” said Sparky. Then, he set his motor
roaring to speed away toward the small airport they
had left.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />
<div>  <span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span></div>
  <h2 id='chap18' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XVIII</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>WHERE ARE THEY?</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“Oh! They’re gone!” Mary exclaimed in dismay
as they came in sight of the airfield.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What? They can’t be!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they are! The bombers are gone. The field
is practically empty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was true. Warnings of an approaching storm
had sent the big bomber squadron roaring on its
way over the mountains. But Mary and Sparky
landed a moment later with plenty of room to spare.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Mary this was a great disappointment. She
dearly loved being in a parade, always had. And flying
in a great formation like that was a big parade.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now we’ll have to go it alone,” she said soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing new about that,” Sparky grinned.
“We’ve made it alone practically all the way and
you’re bound to admit that we’ve had all the luck
any flier could ask.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, all the luck,” Mary repeated slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re tired, Mary,” Sparky said with a show of
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I guess I am. Can’t take it after all, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t take it! Man! Oh! Man!” he roared.
“Listen to you talk!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>Just then Scottie came over from Sparky’s plane.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I covered up the box that the spy pried open,”
he said. “Then I changed the loading so it’s on the
bottom. And believe it or not,” he added, “I didn’t
peek.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The secret compartment?” Mary’s voice rose.
“Had it been broken open?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t know a thing about a secret compartment,”
was Scottie’s reply. “I went over the cabin
with a fine-toothed comb. Everything but that box
seemed okay.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the roll of papyrus is still there and wasn’t
burned up in that plane.” Mary heaved a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So that’s what happened?” said Scottie. “Their
plane burned.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it burned.” Mary spoke slowly. No other
questions were asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Colonel said if you didn’t bring my plane
back in twenty-four hours,” Scottie laughed low,
“that I could have yours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you said?” Sparky asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I said it would be a fair enough trade but that
guys like you and Mary always came back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Mary agreed. “We always come back—sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>“Mary,” said Sparky, “I’m going over our plane,
every bit of it. People who open secret cargoes also
put emery in engines, cut fuel pipes and all that.
When we go over those peaks, everything has to be
right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It certainly does.” Mary was seeing again those
cold, white slopes where a plane forced to land goes
rolling down, down, down, to dizzy depths below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go get a cup of coffee,” she said dreamily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And have a good rest,” said Sparky. “We may go
over the big top yet today. That all depends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>While she was drinking her coffee, Mary was
joined by the Captain who had helped her save the
secret cargo from the would-be hijackers. “Sparky
tells me that you chased that woman spy to her
death,” he said. Mary nodded. “I just wanted to
tell you,” he went on, “that while you were gone, I
did a little investigating. That woman flew to a small
airport owned by a rich native, about forty miles
from here. She must have motored over here,
though her car wasn’t found. Had an accomplice, no
doubt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A man I got on the phone,” he went on, “tells
me she checks with a native Indian woman who
studied in America but who soured on Americans
for some reason or other, and so went into spying.
Looks as if you and Sparky have done the country a
great favor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I’m glad,” Mary swallowed hard. “But for my
part I’ll do my bit some other way after this.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>Two hours later Mary was wakened from a dream
in which she was riding on an ocean liner gliding
rapidly down a swiftly moving mountain stream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mary! Mary!” It was Sparky, calling outside her
tent. “I’m sorry, but orders have come through by
radio. We are to start within the hour!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay. I’ll join you at the canteen for our last
cup of java in Burma.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here’s hoping.” Sparky was away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s not too promising,” he was telling her a half
hour later, talking between gulps of steaming hot
coffee. “The barometer is falling. A storm is on the
way, but the big shots figure we can make it. This
time of year it storms for weeks once it gets a good
start and it seems our cargo is vital to some great
mission.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” Mary drawled sleepily, “the next time
you and I fly together we’ll insist on having a cargo
of toothpicks, crackers, chewing gum, and non-essentials.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something that doesn’t count too much,” he
grinned. “I wonder. It strikes me that you’re just
the sort that insists on doing hard, important things
all the time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might be right at that, and perhaps I’ve got
a buddy that’s built along the same lines,” she answered
smiling.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>“Might be,” he agreed. “Anyway the next hop
promises to be both important and tough so we’d
better get going.” He slid off the stool.</p>

<p class='c012'>Five minutes later, having been joined by Hop
Sing, they were back at the plane. Heavily padded
suits, fur-lined jackets, and marvelous wool socks
were selected with great care for all. Sparky went
through the business of getting set for a long flight,
then, when his motors were rolling, nodded to the
mechanic and they went gliding away.</p>

<p class='c012'>As if by way of a warning from the storm gods, as
they cleared the treetops, a stiff push of wind lifted
their plane high, then let it down with a bump.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, ho!” Sparky shouted. “So that’s how it is!
Blow high! Blow low! Not all your snow can stop
our motors’ steady roar.” He was in high spirits.
But Mary was ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They say that women have instincts,” she said to
Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meaning what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing much, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He set the ship climbing. They went speeding on
toward those eternal fields of white.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the events of the morning had shaken
Mary’s usually steady nerves. Then again the strain
of long, exciting days and nights had begun to tell.
Be that as it may, as they came closer and closer to
those mountains of eternal snow, her apprehension
increased.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>They came close to the place where they must
climb and climb again to make the pass in safety,
and she was obliged to confess to herself that she was
really frightened.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment she recalled the words of a pilot
who had crossed many times. “They call it a pass
but it’s only a slightly lower level between two towering
peaks.” She looked at the peaks and the narrow
depression that lay between them. At the same time
she thought she had discovered a change in the peaks
that lay far to the left.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some of them are gone,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gone? What’s gone?” Sparky asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mountains! They don’t go away. They’re eternal.
It says so in the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same there are not as many as there were,”
Mary insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sparky gave her a sharp look, then he gazed away
to the left.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By thunder! You’re right!” he exclaimed.
“They are vanishing. Know what that means?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A storm!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Absolutely. With the direction of the wind,
quartering to the direction the range takes, that
storm will come and come and come.”</p>

<p><i>“That Means a Storm!” Sparky Exclaimed</i></p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>Even as Mary watched the view away to the left
changed. Instead of simply disappearing each mountain
began to “smoke.” It wasn’t smoke, she knew
that. It was snow blown hundreds, perhaps thousands
of feet into the air.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the moments passed the thing grew in horror
and intensity. Striking the mountains at an angle,
the storm appeared to creep upon them like a thief
in the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s coming, Sparky!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, coming,” he agreed. “And we’re climbing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can we beat it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we can’t we can fight it. I’ve seen storms before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a white storm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, white storms.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not over the Himalayas.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have it your own way,” he grumbled. “Anyway,
we’ll fight. We’ve got it to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Frightened within an inch of her life yet fascinated
by the strangeness, the expression of power,
the beauty of it all, she watched the storm arrive.
Now there were twelve mountains in the calm that
lay between them and their destiny. Now one more
mountain smoked, leaving eleven. Now there were
ten, eight, six, five, four, three.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! It’s almost here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>No answer—only a grim look of utter determination.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>“Sparky! It’s here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>As if a white blanket had been wrapped about
their plane, everything before them vanished. At the
same time, as if it were a child’s toy, the storm caught
their plane and carried it aloft. The motors still
turned, but meant nothing. Had the plane ever
traveled so fast before? Mary doubted it. Where
were they? Where was the mountain? It seemed to
her that they must be approaching the stars. A stinging
cold crept in everywhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then, just as she had begun to despair, still
as if they were toy people in a toy plane of a toy
world, the storm gave their plane a final push, turned
it completely over, then abandoned it to its fate.</p>

<p class='c012'>They began to drop. The motors were no longer
turning. Had that intense cold rendered them useless?
If so their fate was sealed.</p>

<p class='c012'>With benumbed fingers Sparky tried a switch here,
another there. There came a faint humming sound.
It grew and grew. Somewhere a wheel turned, then
another. Then, suddenly, the motors roared.</p>

<p class='c012'>With great skill, Sparky plied his wings, his tail
controls until, slowly, like some great, graceful bird,
the plane turned over.</p>

<p class='c012'>The motors roared on. Five minutes more and
they were hanging in calm, clouded skies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Question right now is, where are we?” Sparky
said after a moment’s silence. “The bear went over
the mountain,” he hummed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>“Yes, but did we?” Mary asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>No one cared to risk his reputation on an answer
to that question.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  <h2 id='chap19' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XIX</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>ST. ELMO’S FIRE</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>“If there are mountains about it’s always best to
climb.” Sparky set his plane to reach higher altitudes.
When at last he felt the push of strong winds
behind him he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The storm took us over the mountains all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s something to be thankful for,” said Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but we’re still more or less lost.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This, they discovered, was truer than they had
thought, for the cold or the push and bang of the
storm had damaged their radio. Try as she might,
Mary could raise no one.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a time, flying by instrument, Sparky flew
across what he hoped was low, level land. Since he
could not be sure of this, he still flew high among
the thick clouds.</p>

<p class='c012'>When at last, in desperation, he dropped lower
and lower until they were dangerously close to the
earth, they found themselves still in a dense formation
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” Mary asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Somewhere over China.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The part held by our own people or by the
enemy?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>“There is no sure way to know. Here, take the
ship. Let me at that radio. We’ve just got to get
it going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Whether this was a “must” or not did not appear
to matter. The radio was dead and apparently would
remain so.</p>

<p class='c012'>To make matters worse the shadows within the
plane grew darker with every passing moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Night,” Mary thought. “Night over a strange
land.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Night settled down and still they cruised on.
From time to time, they came down close to earth,
often too close, in the hope of finding a break in the
clouds, of spotting a landing beacon. No break was
found, no light appeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our position is growing desperate,” Sparky said
at last. “Our fuel is running low. In less than a half
hour we’ll be obliged to make a blind landing and
that, well—you know—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yes, Mary knew. There was no need for her to
answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I’d better get the ship aloft then let the
rest of you take to parachutes.” Sparky’s voice was
husky. “For better or worse, this looks like journey’s
end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—yes, I guess you’d better let Hop Sing use
his parachute. It will be safer for him.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>“Yes, and for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not so much better, Sparky, perhaps much worse
for me if we’re over enemy territory. I’m staying
with the ship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay. It’s your life. I can’t live it for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For a little time they were silent. “About time
to do a little climbing.” Sparky shifted his controls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! What was that?” Mary cried sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What was what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A light!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t see any light.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, there! No, now it’s gone! Yes! Yes, there
it is! By the nose of the plane!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I saw it!” Sparky seemed unimpressed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But look, Sparky!” she exclaimed. “Look at the
radio antennae. They’re like neon tubes! They,
they’re burning up! Sparky! What’s going to happen?
Is the ship on fire?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not so you can notice it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Sparky! Look! There’s a ball of fire on the
ship’s nose—big as a Fourth of July balloon.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—no! Now it’s gone! But, look! There’s a
flash right across the propeller blades!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say! We can begin to see things!” she was fairly
beside herself. “I just saw a house and a clump of
trees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The clouds are lifting,” said Sparky. “There
may be a chance—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>“Yes—there’s a road. It’s broad and white, must
be cement.” Mary grabbed Sparky’s arm. “Sparky!
we’re going to be safe. We’ve been saved by some
kind of miracle!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miracle, my eye!” Sparky grumbled, as he set
his ship for a try at landing on that road. “If I don’t
hit it right on the beam,” he said grimly, “we’ll crash
and that means like as not that this whole trip has
been made for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not for nothing. Don’t forget, there’s the
quinine!”</p>

<p class='c012'>With balls of fire rolling all over the plane and
with their landing lights on for a space of seconds,
they hit that hard road, bounced, hit again and again,
then began to glide. Just before the ship came to a
stop, the right wheel left the road to bury itself in
soft mud.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nice thing to do at the very end!” Sparky
growled. “If we’re in enemy territory we’re in a bad
way!” Snapping off the lights, he headed for the
door.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the strange, rolling balls of light were gone.
About them it was dark as a subway when the lights
are off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” Mary insisted as her feet hit the pavement,
“it was a miracle! You don’t dare say it
wasn’t!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Can’t I!” Sparky squeezed her arm. “At
least I’m bound to try. That, my dear Mary, was
what they call St. Elmo’s Fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>“St. Elmo’s Fire!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sure! It’s a form of electrical disturbance. I
picked it up once when I was half way across the
Atlantic. The scientists say it’s harmless. Probably
they’re partly right, but I claim that a thing that
scares you to death can’t be entirely harmless.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now,” he added, “since we’ve put one more
ghost to rest, let’s find out where we are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hop Sing,” he called.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right here, Mr. Sparky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hop Sing, this is your country, China. Where
are we?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t tell—me. I go see. Mebby quick find somebody
who live here, then quick find out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The stump-stump of Hop Sing’s crutch faded into
the distance. After that, by the plane, for quite some
time there was silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky, I’m tired,” Mary said at last. “I hope we
can get to the end of our trip soon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t hope too much,” he cautioned. “We
wandered about in the sky a long time and that storm
may really have taken us places before it let us
down.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>The darkness was something to brood about. The
big plane loomed like a shadow above them. It
seemed a long time before they again heard the
stump-stump of Hop Sing’s crutch. As it came closer
Mary became conscious of another sound. It was
like the wind rustling through dry leaves. Or was
it a shuffling sound?</p>

<p class='c012'>Before she knew it she found herself surrounded
by silent, shadowy forms and Hop Sing was talking
in a hoarse whisper to Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hop Sing’s report was both astonishing and terrifying.
They were twenty miles behind the Jap
lines. The road on which they had landed ran
parallel to the lines. That was why on a dark night
like this there was no traffic. Men, ammunition and
supplies going to the front traveled a road, some
fifteen miles away, a road that crossed this one.</p>

<p class='c012'>The shadowy forms about them were Chinese,
men, women, and children. These astonishing
people had hidden in the mountains until the battle
lines had swept over them. Now, still hiding in holes
and cellars, they were back near their homes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Most surprising of all,” Sparky whispered to
Mary, “a half mile down this road, and off to one
side, there is a small airfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An airfield! Didn’t the Japs destroy it? Or do
they use it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Neither. They know nothing about it. It’s a
turnip patch, just now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A turnip patch!”</p>

<div class='pbb'></div>
<hr class='pb c001' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>“Sure. These Chinese are smart. This airfield has
always been a secret one. Before the Japs came, they
kept it covered with nets and burlap that made it
look like plowed ground. They only used it at night
for refueling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fuel, that’s what we need!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and it’s there.” Sparky spoke rapidly. “It’s
in a hidden underground room, two drums of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing. These people, like gremlins, gnomes,
or something, are going to do it for us. They’ll
get the plane back on the road. That’s what they’re
doing now.” The plane gave a sudden lurch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then some of them will pull and push the plane
down the road while the women and children remove
enough turnips and earth from the airfield to make
us a runway.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then we’ll fuel up and take off. How sweet!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, if the Japs don’t come. Our journey’s end
is only two hundred miles away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And if the Japs come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll fight. These Chinese have arms. We’ve
got two machine guns. We’ll put up a good scrap.”
The big plane with its precious cargo tilted back
to the road bed. Then, slowly, yard by yard it rolled
down the half mile to the airfield.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>There, by the sense of touch alone, since no lights
could be allowed, Sparky felt his way across the prepared
runway, and Mary supervised the refueling of
the plane, and all the time, Hop Sing was pouring
into her ears stories of his people’s courage and
heroism.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” she breathed at last. “I do hope we can
make it. I don’t know what it’s all about but I do
know that it will mean a great deal to these noble,
fighting Chinese.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At last all was ready.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the aid of a very faint light Sparky and Mary
went through the business of getting the ship going.
At last Sparky gave an order to Hop Sing. Hop Sing
passed it to those on the ground. The motors
thundered and:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Up!” Mary exclaimed. “We’re in the air again!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s not all,” Sparky added happily. “The air
is clearing and we have gas to carry us to our objective.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They reached it before the hour was up. Recognizing
the roar of their plane, a member of the
bomber squadron’s crew sent up a small plane to
guide them in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! At last you’re here,” shouted a voice. The
bomber squadron’s flight commander pulled himself
into their cabin. “We’ll have men here in a
moment to take off your cargo. It is of vital importance.
That’s all I can tell you now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Me,” said Mary, “all I want is sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>“There’s a car waiting for you right now. It will
take you to the city’s best little hotel which is not a
quarter of an hour away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary fell asleep in the car. She roused herself
long enough to reach her room and undress. Then
she traded the world of harsh realities for one of
pleasant dreams.</p>

  <h2 id='chap20' class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER XX</span><br /> <br /><span class='large'>DEEP SECRETS REVEALED</span></h2>
<p class='c011'>When Mary awoke with the sun shining on her
face through a small window next morning it was
with a vague feeling that something was gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” she exclaimed, jumping out of bed. “I’ve
slept too long. Sparky has left me behind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When her bare feet hit the floor she awoke to the
reality of things.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all over,” she sighed, sinking back on her
bed. “We’ve reached the journey’s end at last.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then with a fresh thought stirring her to action
she hurried through her toilet and donned her dusty
uniform.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps this is going to be like Christmas morning,
when secrets are revealed, just perhaps,” she
whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a hasty breakfast she begged a ride out to
the airfield. It was a fairly large airdrome. The runways
were neither long nor numerous but back
among the trees cement had been laid making hiding
places for many planes. And the planes were there.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky!” she exclaimed as she came upon her
companion of many adventures. “Look at the planes!
There must be two hundred of them.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>“Fully that many,” Sparky agreed. “And all
bombers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What does it mean? What is their mission?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your guess is as good as mine,” he grinned. “We
would guess the same thing I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And might be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but one thing is certain, about a hundred of
them are being equipped with the same type of
gadget. And they all came from the packing cases
that only a few hours ago rode in our plane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky! What are they?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shush,” he whispered. “It’s still a deep military
secret. They are being provided with a new and
more perfect type of bombsight than ever has been
used before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So that was it! Sounds quite simple, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very. But in this world the answers to most great
mysteries are usually quite simple. In this case, however,
the mystery concerned something of tremendous
importance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These planes have been assembled here for a task
that the Japs would give a prince or two to know
about. Our flight of bombers, of course, brought
their own bombsights. And they brought other
much needed equipment. For some reason, known
only to the big shots, the bombsights for planes already
here were entrusted to our ship.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>“And if that Jap spy or the Woman in Black had
wrecked our plane!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would have been just too bad. But they
didn’t, so you and I are to be attending a banquet
in your honor tonight. It’s to be quite a brilliant
affair. High-ranking officers from the armies of
China, Great Britain, and America are to be there.
What’s more, you are to make a speech.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no! Sparky,” she cried. “No! No! No!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It won’t be hard, not really,” he assured her.
“They’ll want to know about the first overseas trip
made by a WAF. If you tell them half the things
that have happened to you, they’ll be forever convinced
that the ladies of the Ferry Command can
really take it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Since you put it that way,” Mary replied soberly,
“I’ve got to accept.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s the girl!” Sparky applauded.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary could be quite the lady when occasion demanded.
The wife of a flying Colonel took her
under her wing to help her with dress and make-up.
The beautiful gown she had worn in Egypt was still
at hand and so it happened that a young flying lieutenant
was heard to remark as she entered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>That</i> glorious dame! She never flew a plane in
her life!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Catching the words, Mary blushed, but forgave
the lieutenant on the spot.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>Had not the very substantial Sparky, still in his
uniform, been seated at her side to nod in confirmation
to every strange tale she told, there might have
been many an older head that would have questioned
her story. As it turned out, she was quite the lady
of the hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>For all that, when she found Sparky next morning,
the first thing she asked was: “When do we leave and
how?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’re leaving the good, old Lone Star behind,”
he admitted sadly. “It’s needed for fighting China’s
battles.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’ll forgive them,” she replied instantly.
At that moment she was once again seeing shadowy
forms and a heavy plane moving down a dark highway,
and hearing the crippled Hop Sing tell the story
of his brave people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How are we going to America? Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and where is our roll of papyrus?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The papyrus is still in the secret compartment on
our plane. We’ll go and get it right now. You’ll
carry it in your traveling bag.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just for luck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Luck and perhaps a little further adventure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As to our mode of travel to San Francisco,” he
added, “I’m told that we are to travel just as we have
done in America after we have delivered a job.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>“By transport plane?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dull but restful,” she sighed. “I’m all for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Two days later, together with a score of officers
and men of official distinction, bound for home on
leave or on business, they climbed aboard a giant
airliner and headed out over the Pacific. After long
hours of travel they came swooping down upon a
broad island airfield that, as far as they are concerned,
will remain forever unnamed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here they were greeted by hundreds of American
soldiers who, at first, stared at Mary in disbelief, then
let out a lusty cheer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Beneath the palms that night, with only the stars
for light, and with soldiers, sailors and nurses as an
audience, Mary told her story all over again.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the very midst of her talk, someone set a shiny
object down before her, then whispered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re doing great, sister. Keep right on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Cheered by the marvelous attention of her audience,
she talked for an hour only to learn in the end,
what she had suspected all along, that the last half
of her talk had been broadcast by short wave to
America.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now there’ll be no living with you, Mary,”
Sparky laughed as he escorted her to the nurses’ tent
where she was to spend the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In Heaven’s name, why?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>“You’re famous!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing like that,” she laughed. “Just a flying
fool of the Ferry Command.”</p>

<p class='c012'>From here they hopped along in a leisurely
manner to Honolulu.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many a time in her younger days Mary had
dreamed of sitting beneath the palms on the
Hawaiian Islands. But on this trip she had seen
palms in Brazil, North Africa, Egypt, Persia, India,
China and the islands of the sea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s one palm more or less?” she said to
Sparky. “Here’s hoping we catch an early plane
home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were obliged to wait two days before the
long hop for San Francisco. It was on the evening
of their last day at Honolulu, while they were seated
in the lounge of their hotel, that a real thrill came
over them as they listened to the radio.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen!” Sparky sat up suddenly. Mary shifted
to face the radio.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are now permitted to report,” said a voice in
far away China: “that, four days ago, Tokio was
heavily bombed by an airforce of great strength and
that an enormous amount of damage was done to
steel mills, airplane factories and other objectives.
All our planes returned safely to their base.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here it comes!” Mary whispered tensely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the pay-off,” Sparky agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>“Here in the studio with me now,” the voice on
the radio went on, “is Flight Commander Major
Tom Cole. Major Cole, will you tell us a little about
that raid?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I certainly will,” came in another voice. “It was
magnificently planned and executed with great daring
and tremendous success.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Were you able to sight your objectives?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And how! Those bombardiers just laid those
blockbusters right on top of the targets.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was much damage done?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should say that fully a third of the factories,
mills, and steel mills in the Tokio area had been put
out of commission for weeks, perhaps months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Tokio itself?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All I can say is that if I lived in a paper house,
I’d never start a war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, Major. Oh! One thing more. There
is a rumor about that a girl, Mary Mason, of the
WAFS, had something to do with the success of this
effort. Could this be true?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not only could it be true—it is true. Much of
the success of this mission is due to the loyal service
of the young lady you mentioned. I, of course, can’t
give you details. I will say that she no longer is in
China.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In Honolulu, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>“I wouldn’t know. Those gals really get about.
All I want to say is that, wherever Mary Mason is
tonight, our hats are off to her. Every man who flew
on that mission would be glad to shake her hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so ladies and gentlemen—” The broadcast
ended.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” Mary breathed, sinking deep into her big
chair. “What did you say, Sparky—the pay-off?”</p>

<p class='c012'>As Mary started for her room a short while later
a reporter stepped up to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Might you be Mary Mason?” he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I might and I might not. You should know that
we are not permitted to divulge secrets to strangers,
particularly when we are on duty.” Once more
Mary was on her way.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>When they landed in San Francisco one morning
at nine, Mary carried a mysterious package under
her arm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sparky,” she said, “I’ve carried this roll of papyrus
half way round the world. The first thing I
want to do in America is to get rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Okay, I’m with you,” was his quick response,
“We’ll sit on a stool long enough for coffee, toast,
and bacon, then we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When, three hours later, they alighted from a cab
before an imposing home hidden behind tall
shrubbery in one of the city’s finest suburbs, Mary’s
hands gripped the roll of papyrus. Her tense fingers
trembled slightly as, with Sparky at her side, she
marched up the winding walk.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>“This is the place,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And this the hour,” he agreed. “Keep a stiff
upper lip. Everything will be fine and dandy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same, I don’t like it.” She gripped his
arm. “I’d rather be right up there in the sky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Even in Burma?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, even that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then a half block away, a heavy car slid up to
the curb. Three husky men sprang out and marched
briskly up the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The cast is all here. The stage is set,” Sparky
whispered, as he rang the door bell.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their ring was answered at once. A blonde-haired
maid ushered them in. She led them to a door,
tapped, then waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come in! Come in!” a large voice welcomed as
the door swung open. “I have been expecting you.”
The large, red-faced man waved them to chairs close
by his mahogany desk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now we shall see!” He breathed heavily as his
hand gripped the roll of papyrus. “Perhaps this is
genuine, and perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After unrolling the parchment, he sat for a full
minute studying the first, full sheet through his
thick glasses—so intently that one might have said he
was trying to read something not written there at
all.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>Sparky gave Mary a meaningful look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” the big man drew in a deep breath, “this
is genuine, and should be of great service to humanity
by revealing the real life of those strange
beings who lived so long ago. You have been at
great pains to bring this to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He doesn’t know the half of it,” Mary thought,
smiling to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must allow me to pay you for your trouble,”
he went on. “How much do I owe you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! Noth—but nothing.” Mary hated herself
for stammering. “But I wish you would look at all
the sheets and per—perhaps count them,” she added
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well. I shall do as you say.” The big man’s
thumb and finger reached for the first sheet. Sparky
half rose in his chair. From outside came a faint
sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One,” the big man counted, “two, three, four—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary’s heart fluttered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then—” The big man did not finish. Instead
he sat there staring and as he did so his face
purpled. A slip of paper had been inserted between
the sheets of papyrus. On it had been written these
words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are Peter Schwartz.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>That was all. This could have been a harmless
trick had he not for years lived in America under
quite another name, and had not Peter Schwartz
been wanted for some time by certain gentlemen
who made their homes in Washington.</p>

<p class='c012'>Half rising in his chair, the big man reached for
the right-hand drawer of his desk. Sparky beat him
to it, striking his arm down. And then the big man
found himself surrounded by three men, each as
large as himself and more powerful.</p>

<p class='c012'>A pair of handcuffs clicked. “Come on, Schwartz,”
one of the men said gruffly while another lingered
for a word with Mary and Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nice work,” he commended. “The F.B.I. owes
you a debt of gratitude, as does our government.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Most of the credit goes to Mary’s father,” said
Sparky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And to his friends, the Egyptologist and the one
who knows so much about lights.” Mary amended.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see,” said Sparky. “As soon as we showed
them the roll of papyrus they put a sheet of it under
the infra-red light.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that brought out all sorts of things you
couldn’t see with the eye,” Mary broke in. “Maps,
charts, figures and all kinds of messages in code.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enough to tell our enemy all they’d like to know
about Egypt,” the F.B.I. now agreed. “They’ll never
know now. The proper sort of bath will remove all
their fancy maps and messages. And then—” he
paused. “What about that roll of papyrus?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>“Let us know when you’re through using it as
evidence,” said Sparky. “Then we’ll try to find
out what will happen to it next.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten minutes later they were once more out in the
glorious sunshine of their native land. Sparky hailed
a cab and together they rode to the little hotel where
the girls of the Ferry Command stay when they are
in the city.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they entered the lobby Mary saw one of the
girls she knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Greetings,” she called.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Same to you,” came back. “Where did you just
come in from?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Been round the world,” Mary smiled slyly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yeah?” Then the girl’s look changed. “Say,
that’s right! You’re Mary Mason! I heard you on
the radio!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! I hoped no one would hear!” Mary was
startled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everybody did. Say! It was great! And now all
the girls want to cross the ocean. And say! There’s
a telegram for you at the desk! Yes, and a letter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A telegram! A letter!” Mary marched to the
desk, received the telegram, and the letter, then stood
staring.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>The letter had given her a real thrill. It was not
really a letter, only a picture on a postcard with
some writing on the back. The picture was of a fine
young American soldier in uniform. On its back she
read: “You asked for it, so here it is.” It was signed
“Jerry Sikes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That boy in South America,” she whispered.
“How grand!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But the telegram?</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter? Bad news?” Sparky asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll say so!” Mary made a face. “It’s from the
WAF central office. They’ve booked me to appear
before three women’s flying clubs. I’m to recruit
fliers for our organization. Oh, when will we two
fly again?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time enough for that,” said Sparky. “Just let
me know when your lecture tour is over and I’ll see
what can be cooked up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Mary,” he said as their hands met, “you
saw a lot of nice boys on that trip.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I sure did, Sparky.” Her eyes shone. “But the
best of them all—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was the gray-haired one who met you in Egypt,”
Sparky said smilingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right, Sparky—my dad—but next to him,
the finest of them all was the guy who went with me
all the way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, Mary. I’m glad you feel that way, for
you’re the grandest girl I know. I’ll be seeing you.”
He turned to march away.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>“Oh! Gee!” Mary thought. “Life sure is funny!
Some of the things that happen to you make you
feel all funny inside, but when there’s a war and
you’re in it, you just have to let it go—for the
duration.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Some presumed printers’ errors have been corrected without mention,
including normalizing punctuation and minor spelling errors.</p>

<p class='c016'>page 16 - probably publisher's error -
"After climbing steeply she leveled off to start down at the clearing" -
changed to "... stare down at ...."</p>

<p class='c016'>page 49 - "near with the firebottle" changed to "near with the fire bottle"</p>

<p class='c016'>page 59 and two other pages - “gage” is used where we would today use "gauge" -
left the word as is, it seems to be a slightly archaic spelling but is used consistently in the text</p>

<p class='c016'>page 97  - "The pilot didn’t bale out"
left as is, instead of changing to "bail out" - some references indicated
that "bale out" is correct for "using a parachute to escape a plane"</p>

<p class='c016'>page 169 - “The monkeys are sacred. Religion is a potent, force to these people”
comma after “potent” removed</p>

<p class='c016'>page 182 - “You loose your two bucks. She’s a lady”
“loose” changed to “lose”</p>

<p class='c016'>page 217 - “People who open secret cargos also”
“cargos” changed to “cargoes”</p>

<p class='c016'>page 223 - removed extraneous comma after "some"
"...his tail controls until, slowly, like some, great, graceful bird..."
changed to "...his tail controls until, slowly, like some great, graceful bird..."</p>

<p class='c016'>page 237 - “China, Great Britian, and America are to be there.”
changed “Britian” to “Britain”</p>

<p class='c016'>page 242 - “we are not permitted to devulge secrets”
changed “devulge” to “divulge”</p>
